Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the fatal crash that claimed the lives of two young children. The incident occurred on the A34 motorway near Newbury, Berkshire, last Saturday. Eyewitnesses reported seeing Maj Scott's car weaving in and out of traffic before losing control and colliding with another vehicle.

The driver of that car, a 32-year-old woman, sustained serious injuries and is currently in critical condition at a local hospital. Maj Scott, a decorated military officer, has been charged with dangerous driving causing death and grievous bodily harm. He appeared before the magistrates' court earlier today and was released on bail.

The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols, as the authorities strive to promote secularism and maintain social stability in the region. The ban specifically targets clothing and symbols associated with Islam, such as the hijab and the crescent moon and star. This decision follows similar measures implemented in other parts of the country, where the government has been cracking down on religious expression deemed to be a threat to the state's authority. Critics argue that these bans infringe on the rights of religious minorities, particularly the Muslim community, and exacerbate tensions between different ethnic and religious groups. Supporters, on the other hand, believe that such measures are necessary to combat religious extremism and maintain social harmony. China's Muslim population is estimated to be around 23 million people, primarily residing in the western region of Xinjiang. This latest ban further adds to the ongoing debate surrounding religious freedom in China and raises concerns about the

The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the think tank today and highlights a significant educational divide between different regions in the UK. According to the study, children from disadvantaged backgrounds in London achieved better academic results compared to their peers in the north of England. The research indicates that London's success in narrowing the attainment gap is due to a combination of various factors, including effective policies and investment in education. The report calls for increased funding and attention to be directed towards schools in the north, in order to bridge the educational divide. The IPPR emphasizes that narrowing the gap is not just about improving individual outcomes, but also about addressing wider social and economic inequalities. While the report acknowledges the progress made in London, it also underscores the need for a comprehensive and coordinated effort to ensure that all children, regardless of their background or location, have equal access to high-quality education.

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be substantial, as the maintenance and fuel costs for the unused engines have been a burden on the city's budget.

Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure indicates that the UK's job market has remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. The ONS also revealed that the number of people in employment rose by 99,000 during the same period, reaching a record high of 32.7 million. This suggests that businesses are still hiring and expanding despite concerns about the country's future relationship with the European Union. However, wage growth remains sluggish, with average weekly earnings increasing by only 3.2% excluding bonuses. This is below the rate of inflation, indicating that workers are not seeing much improvement in their purchasing power. Experts have attributed the low unemployment rate to a combination of factors, including the rise of the gig economy and more people opting for self-employment. However, concerns remain about the quality of jobs being created, as many are part-time or offer low wages. Overall, the latest data suggests a mixed picture of the UK

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night session, sparking outrage among opposition parties and the public alike. The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. Critics argue that this bill is a brazen attempt by the ruling party to protect its own interests and maintain its hold on power. It is seen as a way to whitewash the crimes committed by politicians and their supporters during this tumultuous period. The opposition argues that this amnesty undermines justice and accountability, sending the wrong message to the public that those in power are above the law. They believe that it is crucial for those responsible for any wrongdoing to be held accountable, regardless of their political affiliation. Proponents of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to heal the deep divisions within society and move forward. They claim that the amnesty will help foster reconciliation and unity among the Thai people, allowing the nation to focus on the future rather than being shackled by the past. Regardless of the political arguments,
Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands. Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease. By planting acorns, Forest Enterprise Scotland hopes to create a sustainable ecosystem that will foster the growth of oak trees and encourage the return of diverse wildlife. This initiative aligns with the Scottish government's commitment to increase woodland coverage and combat biodiversity loss.
Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to take a leading role in providing long-term financing for green projects in emerging markets. Mr Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of sustainable investments for the stability of the global financial system. During his speech in Berlin, Mr Carney highlighted that emerging markets often face challenges in accessing funding for their green initiatives. He stressed the need for developed nations, like Germany, to step up and support these projects, as they not only contribute to environmental sustainability but also promote financial stability. Germany, known for its commitment to renewable energy and its transition towards a greener economy, is well-positioned to take a leading role in providing the necessary financing. Mr Carney emphasized that by doing so, Germany could both strengthen its own economic growth and contribute significantly to addressing the global climate crisis. The call by Mr Carney aligns with the growing recognition that sustainable investments are crucial for the transition to a low-carbon economy. By investing in green projects, countries can not only mitigate climate
Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, on June 6th. Gene Palmer, a correctional officer at the prison, was taken into custody today for allegedly assisting in their escape. Palmer is suspected of providing tools to the inmates, which were then used to cut through steel walls and pipes in order to make their getaway. He has also been accused of turning a blind eye to the prisoners' activities, failing to report their suspicious behavior. Authorities believe that Palmer had a close relationship with Mitchell, who worked in the prison's tailor shop and is accused of providing the men with hacksaw blades, chisels, and other tools.

The escape of Matt and Sweat has sparked a massive manhunt, involving hundreds of law enforcement officers. The search has been concentrated in the heavily wooded areas surrounding the prison, with authorities
The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be held within six months of the manifesto's enactment. However, there seems to be a delay in calling for the referendum, as the party is facing opposition from various factions. The funding floor proposal is aimed at ensuring fair and equal distribution of resources among regions. It aims to address the long-standing issue of funding disparities and promote economic growth in underdeveloped areas. While the manifesto promised to prioritize this measure, it now appears to be on hold until the referendum is organized. Critics argue that the delay in calling for the referendum is a deliberate tactic to avoid addressing the funding floor issue. They claim that the party is using the referendum as a convenient excuse to delay or potentially abandon the funding floor altogether. Supporters, on the other hand, argue that the referendum is necessary to gauge public opinion and ensure democratic decision-making. They maintain that rushing into

It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future as a major car rental company announced its plans to expand its electric vehicle fleet.  Enterprise, the largest car rental company in the United States, revealed that it will be adding 350 electric vehicles to its offering in select cities. This move comes as part of the company's commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint.  The expansion of the electric vehicle fleet will provide customers with a greener alternative for their transportation needs. By opting for electric vehicles, individuals can contribute to a cleaner environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.  Enterprise's decision also aligns with the global push towards sustainable transportation solutions. Many countries have set ambitious targets to transition to electric vehicles, aiming to phase out gasoline and diesel-powered cars. This trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, as more people are becoming conscious of the environmental impact of their transportation choices.  As we move towards a future where shared transportation becomes the norm, initiatives like Enterprise's electric vehicle fleet

The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone "flash past" the aircraft while traveling south of Brookmans Park last August. This incident has once again raised concerns regarding the safety of drones and their potential to disrupt air traffic. The pilot, who was en route from Luton Airport, immediately notified air traffic control about the close encounter. An investigation was launched, and it was determined that the drone had flown within just a few meters of the aircraft. This incident highlights the need for stricter regulations and increased education around drone usage. The popularity of drones has surged in recent years, but their misuse poses a significant risk to aviation safety. Incidents like this one serve as a reminder that drone operators must adhere to the rules and regulations set by aviation authorities. Authorities are now urging drone users to be responsible and fly their devices safely and responsibly. It is essential for drone operators to understand the potential dangers they pose to aircraft and to comply with regulations to ensure the safety of all airspace users.
A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace. The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues. Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society. The survey findings have sparked calls for employers to reassess their policies and offer more extensive and flexible paternity leave options. It is crucial for companies to recognize the importance of supporting new fathers, fostering a

As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast. The decision by the Parades Commission has sparked controversy and reignited tensions between the Orange Order and the Catholic community. Critics argue that the restriction is a clear demonstration of religious discrimination, as the parade route has historically included this section of the city. The Orange Order, however, claims that the decision is necessary to avoid potential clashes and maintain order. The commission's ruling has received mixed reactions from both sides of the divide. Some Protestant groups are supportive, stating that it is a step towards maintaining peace and preventing further violence. On the other hand, Catholic organizations believe that the decision undermines their rights and perpetuates a sectarian divide. The debate surrounding this issue highlights the ongoing challenges faced by Northern Ireland in finding a balance between cultural expression and the need for peaceful coexistence. The delicate task of regulating parades will continue to

Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died after being overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning on a boat trip in the Lake District in 2013. The court heard that Eteson had failed to properly maintain the vessel's exhaust system, leading to the tragic incident. Prosecutors argued that the defendant's negligence and disregard for the safety of his passengers resulted in their untimely deaths. It was revealed that Eteson had attempted to repair the exhaust system himself, despite lacking the necessary expertise. This led to a fatal leak of carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas. Witnesses recounted how Webster and Thornton had complained of feeling unwell during the boat trip, describing symptoms such as headaches and dizziness. Tragically, their conditions rapidly deteriorated, and both women died before they could receive medical attention. Eteson's defense team argued that he had acted without malice and had not been aware of the dangers posed by the faulty exhaust system. They claimed that his actions were merely a tragic error, rather than a criminal
NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood types in emergencies. The organization is urging people with O negative blood to come forward and donate, as stocks are running low. Blood group O negative is considered the universal donor type because it lacks the A and B antigens found in other blood groups. This means it can be given to patients of any blood type in an emergency situation when there isn't enough time to determine their specific blood type. NHSBT relies on regular blood donations to ensure a steady supply for hospitals across the country. However, recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a decline in blood donations, resulting in a shortage of O negative blood. By donating blood, individuals can help save lives and provide a crucial lifeline to those in need. NHSBT has implemented strict safety measures to protect donors during the donation process, including social distancing, enhanced cleaning, and
The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of £1.1m which it was awarding to a specific group of workers. The premium payment, known as the Additional Duties Allowance (ADA), was being given to support staff in the education sector, including caretakers, classroom assistants, and administrative staff. The decision to remove the ADA has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that the funds can be better utilized elsewhere, such as improving educational resources or investing in teacher training. They believe that the ADA was an unnecessary expense that did not directly contribute to the quality of education. However, critics argue that the removal of the premium payment will adversely affect the livelihoods of already underpaid and undervalued support staff. They argue that these workers, who play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth running of schools, deserve fair compensation for their additional duties. Dr Farry defended his decision, stating that the removal of the

S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model. S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain. Davies believes that S4C should explore alternative funding models, such as partnerships with other broadcasters or introducing advertising, to ensure its long-term sustainability. He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms. While S4C has faced funding challenges in recent years, it continues to play a crucial role in promoting the Welsh language and culture. A comprehensive review of its funding and remit could help ensure that S4C remains relevant and accessible to
The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also strong, reflecting a positive trend in Scotland's job market. According to the report, this surge in placements was driven by increased business confidence and a gradual reopening of the economy. The data revealed that permanent job placements in Scotland rose at the fastest rate since October 2018. This can be attributed to several factors, including the easing of pandemic restrictions and an upturn in hiring across various sectors. The report also highlighted that the demand for temporary staff saw a robust increase, indicating a growing need for flexibility in the workforce. Furthermore, the report underlined a rise in starting salaries for both permanent and temporary positions. This suggests that employers are competing for top talent as the job market gains momentum. With the reopening of businesses and the vaccination rollout continuing to progress, Scotland's employment landscape appears to be on a positive trajectory. However, the report also noted that candidate availability continued to decline, posing a challenge for employers seeking skilled workers. This scarcity of talent could potentially hinder the pace of economic recovery in the region

The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. The government currently contributes £22m annually towards the preservation and maintenance of these iconic landmarks, but with the establishment of this charity, the responsibility for their upkeep will now be shared.

The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00, marking a major milestone for South Korea's space program. This launch was the country's first successful attempt at putting a satellite into orbit using its own rocket. The KSLV-1, also known as Naro, was developed jointly by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Previous attempts in 2009 and 2010 were unsuccessful due to technical issues. The successful launch of the KSLV-1 is a significant achievement for South Korea, as it now joins a select group of nations capable of independently launching satellites into space. This will not only boost the country's scientific and technological capabilities but also open up new opportunities for commercial space ventures. The satellite, named the KOMPSAT-3, is an Earth observation satellite that will provide high-resolution images for various applications, including resource mapping

Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a "hoax" and has repeatedly rolled back environmental regulations during his tenure. However, a group of activists have found a unique way to challenge his stance by borrowing the names of prominent organizations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These activists, known as "identity hackers," use the credibility associated with these well-respected institutions to criticize President Trump's climate change denial. By adopting these names, they aim to draw attention to the urgent need for action on environmental issues and highlight the stark contrast between scientific consensus and the president's dismissive rhetoric. While some argue that this tactic may be misleading or manipulative, others see it as a necessary strategy to counterbalance the Trump administration's disregard for scientific evidence. By borrowing these esteemed names, the identity hackers hope to spark public discourse and hold the president accountable for his stance on climate change. As the battle over climate change continues, these identity hackers serve as a reminder that the fight for environmental protection is far from over. With their unique approach,

The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four "de-escalation zones" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition groups have expressed skepticism and concerns over the effectiveness of this agreement. The aim of these de-escalation zones is to reduce violence and create a safe environment for civilians in Syria. However, opposition groups fear that this deal could further divide the country and consolidate the power of President Bashar al-Assad. The four zones are located in rebel-held areas: Idlib province, parts of Homs province, Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, and the south of the country. While these areas have been heavily targeted by government forces, the opposition argues that the deal fails to address the root causes of the conflict. Furthermore, there are concerns about the monitoring and enforcement of this agreement. Despite Russia, Turkey, and Iran's involvement, opposition groups are skeptical about their commitment to protecting civilians and ensuring the ceasefire holds. This deal comes as the Syrian war enters its seventh year, with more than 400,000 people killed and millions displaced. The opposition groups are calling for a comprehensive solution that addresses the political

However, much attention is focused on the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal challenges. McGarry was found guilty of embezzling funds from a pro-independence campaign group, while Thompson faced charges of assault and domestic abuse. The party will have to decide whether to allow these individuals to run as candidates, despite their legal issues. While some argue for forgiveness and second chances, others believe that allowing them to stand as representatives undermines the party's credibility and integrity. The decision regarding McGarry and Thompson will undoubtedly be a difficult one for the party leadership.

The outcome will also have broader implications, as it will shape public perception of the party and its stance

However, the charity remains determined to push for the resettlement target to be met, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. As winter approaches, the need for immediate action cannot be understated. Providing adequate shelter and support to Syrian refugees should be a priority for the international community
The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with the online publication, The Daily Beast, in 2010 but has struggled to adapt to the rapidly changing media landscape. The decision to end the print edition comes as no surprise, given the ongoing decline in print advertising revenue. Newsweek was once a prominent player in the world of journalism, known for its investigative reporting and in-depth analysis. However, like many print publications, it has faced significant challenges in recent years. The rise of digital media and the changing habits of readers, who increasingly turn to online platforms for news, have put immense pressure on traditional print publications.

Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him "significant discomfort and hindering his performance on the field. The surgery was a success, and Arteta is expected to make a full recovery in time for the new season. Arteta, a key figure in the midfield for the club, has been battling with the ankle issue for some time now. Despite his best efforts to manage the pain and continue playing, it became evident that surgery was necessary to address the root cause of the problem. The bony spur, a small outgrowth of bone, was causing friction and inflammation in Arteta's ankle, leading to pain and restricted mobility. The decision for surgery was made jointly by Arteta, the club's medical staff, and specialists, who deemed it the best course of action to ensure the player's long-term fitness and performance. Arteta's absence from the team during his recovery will undoubtedly be felt, as his leadership and tactical awareness on the pitch are highly valued by his teammates and the coaching staff.

Sterling rose 1.86% against the dollar to $1.32.40, and was 1.73% higher against the euro, signaling a boost for the British currency. The increase comes as investors gained confidence in the UK economy following the vaccine rollout and signs of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The strengthening of the pound against both major currencies is seen as a positive development for the UK, as it reflects growing optimism about the prospects of a post-pandemic economic rebound. Market participants are hopeful that the successful vaccination campaign will lead to a faster reopening of the economy and a return to normalcy. Furthermore, the positive exchange rate movements bode well for UK businesses engaged in international trade, making exports more competitive and potentially boosting foreign investment. However, analysts warn that uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the potential impact on the economy remain. The pound's performance will continue to be closely monitored, as any significant fluctuations could have far-reaching implications for businesses and consumers alike.
The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of "buildings as power stations". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy. The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change. The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality. If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment. The Specific innovation centre is at the forefront of this groundbreaking research, pushing
Erika Murray, 31, was arrested on Thursday night after a neighbor alerted police over the safety of other children living at the house. Detectives arrived at the residence in Blackstone, Massachusetts, to find a shocking scene of squalor and neglect. Upon entering the home, authorities were confronted with deplorable conditions. The stench of filth and decay engulfed the premises, with mountains of garbage and debris strewn across every room. The discovery of four children, ranging in age from three months to 13 years old, added to the horror. Reports indicate that Murray had been living in the house with the children for an extended period of time. The children appeared malnourished and neglected, with signs of physical and psychological abuse evident. Murray now faces a multitude of charges, including child neglect, endangerment, and assault. The children have been removed from the home and placed under protective custody. Neighbors expressed their shock and disbelief, as there had been no indication of
The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded the campaign group Cure the NHS, has recently claimed that the care at Stafford Hospital was so dire that some patients were reduced to drinking water from vases. Bailey also highlighted the shocking practice of receptionists assessing emergency cases instead of trained medical professionals. These claims come as a devastating blow to the reputation of the hospital, which has already faced severe criticism following a public inquiry in 2013. The inquiry revealed a catalogue of failures, including inadequate care, neglect, and unnecessary patient deaths. Bailey, whose mother sadly died at Stafford Hospital, has been a prominent figure in the fight for justice and improved patient care. Her campaign has been instrumental in bringing the hospital's failings to light and pushing for accountability. The revelations regarding patients drinking water from vases and receptionists taking on medical responsibilities further underscore the urgent need for reform in the healthcare system. It is imperative that patient safety remains a top priority, and that incidents like these are not repeated in the future.
Yorkshire batsman Joe Root has been named as the new Test captain after Alastair Cook resigned after more than four years in charge. "We are delighted to announce that Joe Root will be taking over the reins as the captain of our Test team," said England Cricket Board chairman, Colin Graves. Root, 26, who has already captained England in limited-overs cricket, is renowned for his exceptional batting skills and is widely regarded as one of the team's most talented players. With an impressive average of over 52 in Test cricket, Root has consistently been a key contributor to England's success. Cook, who captained England in a record 59 Tests, decided to step down after a disappointing tour of India. Root's appointment comes as no surprise, as the Yorkshireman has long been seen as Cook's heir apparent. England fans and cricket enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the impact Root will have in his new leadership role.
Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea. The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options. The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods. The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support. The fallout from Hanjin's receivership serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability
Buckingham Palace announced on Friday evening that the Queen would not attend because she had gastroenteritis. Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan Byron Lewis expressed his disappointment at the news, as he had been eagerly anticipating her presence at the upcoming event. The Queen's absence is particularly significant as this event was meant to commemorate a special milestone in the region's history. The Queen's health has always been a matter of concern for her subjects, given her age and the demanding nature of her duties.

The community is hopeful that the Queen will make a swift recovery and be able to resume her duties soon. The news of the Queen's illness serves as a reminder that
The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year. A probation report three months earlier had highlighted concerns about Jetha's behavior, raising questions about whether proper action was taken to prevent this unfortunate incident. According to the report, Jetha had a history of aggression and violent outbursts, particularly towards vulnerable individuals. Despite these red flags, it appears that appropriate measures were not taken to protect potential victims, and the consequences have been devastating. The attack on the young child raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of the probation system and its ability to adequately assess and manage individuals with a propensity for violence. There is an urgent need for a thorough review of the processes and protocols in place, ensuring that adequate safeguards are implemented to protect the most vulnerable members of society. This tragic incident is a stark reminder of the importance of effective risk assessment and intervention. The child involved in this attack deserves justice, and steps must be taken to ensure that

The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be detrimental to the UK's reputation as a welcoming destination for international students. He argued that imposing stricter English language requirements would hinder the ability of talented students to access higher education in the UK. Scott emphasized that the current language requirements are already stringent, ensuring students can effectively communicate and engage in their studies. He also pointed out that many universities offer language support services to help students improve their English proficiency during their studies. The head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs further highlighted the significant contributions that international students make to the country's economy and culture. They not only enrich the academic environment but also support local businesses and communities. Instead of imposing tougher language requirements, Scott suggested that efforts should focus on providing additional language support services to students who may need assistance. This approach would maintain the UK's reputation as a preferred destination for international students while ensuring they have the necessary language skills to succeed in their studies.
The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be vigilant and proactive in managing their credit cards to avoid falling into financial distress. The regulatory body's recent report highlighted that a significant number of credit card users were carrying high balances for extended periods, resulting in substantial interest charges. These customers were often stuck in a cycle of minimum repayments, which barely covered the interest, let alone made a dent in the principal amount. The FCA emphasized the need for cardholders to regularly review their payments and consider alternative repayment strategies, such as paying more than the minimum amount due or consolidating balances onto lower-interest cards. In addition, the authority called for greater transparency from credit card providers regarding the long-term costs of carrying high balances. It urged firms to provide clearer information on interest rates and repayment options to help customers make informed decisions. While the FCA acknowledged that credit cards can be a useful financial tool when managed well
Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his controversial bid for a third term, leading to widespread protests and subsequent crackdowns. The arrested journalists, whose identities and nationalities were not disclosed, were taken into custody for allegedly breaching visa regulations and engaging in unauthorized activities. The police accused them of jeopardizing national security by reporting on armed groups operating in the country. The incident has raised concerns about press freedom and the government's commitment to transparency. Burundi has a history of suppressing critical voices and curtailing media freedom. Human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government's actions, citing the high number of journalists and activists who have faced harassment, intimidation, or imprisonment. The arrest of these two foreign journalists further highlights the challenges faced by media professionals operating in the country. International organizations and press associations have called for the immediate release of the detained journalists and a thorough investigation
Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it "difficult to control his emotions and impulses." Ben Butler, now infamous for the murder of his six-year-old daughter Elsa, had a history of violent outbursts that were consistently overlooked by the authorities. Dr Tim Green's assessment of Butler's mental state, conducted nearly two decades ago, paints a disturbing picture of a man struggling to regulate his emotions. Green noted that Butler had a propensity for explosive anger, finding it hard to rein in his impulses. Despite this early warning sign, Butler's violent tendencies were not effectively addressed or treated, allowing them to escalate over the years. Tragically, this untreated aggression culminated in the horrific murder of his own child, leaving a nation in shock and mourning. Questions are now being raised about the adequacy of the mental health support system in identifying and intervening in cases like Butler's. The failure to adequately address his violent tendencies raises concerns about the potential dangers posed by individuals struggling with similar issues. As the investigation unfolds, it is imperative that authorities pay heed to the warnings

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. The announcement came as a response to concerns raised by Mumbere's legal team regarding his deteriorating health condition. The king has been in custody since his arrest in 2016 on charges of treason and murder. According to his lawyers, Mumbere's health has significantly worsened during his time in detention. They argue that his medical conditions require specialized care and regular monitoring. The court agreed with these concerns and has granted the king access to better healthcare facilities, including regular check-ups and necessary treatments. Being a person with hypertension and diabetes puts Mumbere at higher risk of developing complications, particularly if his conditions are not managed properly. The court's decision reflects the recognition of the importance of providing appropriate medical care to all individuals, irrespective of their legal status. Mumbere's case has been a subject of controversy, with some critics accusing the government
These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub. This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory. Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats. Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries. The heart

The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been reduced by 25 basis points to stimulate economic growth and boost lending. The move by the central bank is aimed at providing relief to businesses and consumers amidst a slowdown in the economy. The decision comes as the country grapples with trade tensions and weakening domestic demand. The central bank hopes that the rate cut will encourage borrowing and investment, ultimately supporting growth. Experts have mixed opinions about the impact of this rate cut. While some believe it will provide a much-needed boost to the economy, others argue that it may not be enough to counter the effects of the ongoing trade dispute. Nevertheless, the cut is seen as a proactive measure by the central bank to address the current economic challenges. Market reactions to the rate cut have been largely positive, with stocks rallying and investors expressing optimism. However, it remains to be seen how the rate cut will translate
The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called "bearer bonds". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to maintain anonymity in their financial transactions. The investigation comes as US authorities crack down on money laundering and illicit financial activities. Bearer bonds are financial instruments that grant ownership rights to whoever physically holds the bond. Because ownership is not registered, they have long been associated with illicit activities, such as tax evasion and money laundering. These bonds offer an attractive option for individuals seeking to move large sums of money discreetly across borders. The Swiss bank, which has not been named, is being scrutinized for its potential involvement in the sale and handling of these bonds. US regulators are closely examining whether the bank facilitated the transfer of bearer bonds for clients, potentially aiding in illegal financial activities. This investigation is part of a broader effort by US authorities to increase transparency in financial transactions and clamp down on unlawful practices. The anonymity provided by bearer bonds has been exploited by individuals looking to evade taxes and launder money. By investigating potential sales of these bonds, regulators aim to deter such illicit activities and promote a more secure and
The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The firm in question is facing allegations of using its financial power to influence the South Korean government. The accusations suggest that the firm made substantial donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, who is known to be a close confidante of former President Park Geun-hye. These donations have raised suspicions of corruption and undue influence, as Choi Soon-sil is currently serving a prison sentence for her involvement in a major political scandal that led to Park's impeachment in 2017. The scandal shook South Korea, revealing a web of political corruption and abuse of power. The firm's alleged actions have sparked public outrage and further eroded trust in the country's business and political elite. Critics argue that such practices undermine the principles of fairness and transparency that are essential for a healthy democracy. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing, and if proven true, the firm may face legal consequences. This case serves as a stark reminder of the need for rigorous oversight and ethical practices within the corporate sector,

By integrating the purchasing process into its search engine, Google hopes to offer a more convenient and efficient way for customers to buy products. The Buy on Google button would display product details, prices, and reviews right within the search results. Users would be able to select their desired items and complete the purchase with just a few clicks. Google intends to partner with various retailers to provide a wide range of products for purchase through this feature. Although the option is currently in the testing phase, if successful, it could potentially change the way people shop online, making it easier and faster to find and buy products without navigating multiple websites.

An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid its rent for the past two years. The shocking revelation came to light during a recent meeting of the Welsh Assembly's Economy, Infrastructure, and Skills Committee. Cardiff Aviation, once hailed as a beacon of hope for the local economy, has been struggling financially for several years. The company, founded by aviation entrepreneur Bruce Dickinson, leased the hangar at St Athan to carry out aircraft maintenance and training. However, it seems their financial woes have caught up with them. The committee was informed by an official that Cardiff Aviation had failed to make rent payments for the past two years. This news raises serious concerns about the company's viability and its ability to continue operating at the site. The hangar, which was previously used by the Ministry of Defence, was leased to Cardiff Aviation by the Welsh government in an effort to revive the local economy and create job opportunities. The failure to pay rent not only reflects poorly on the company's financial management but also raises questions about the Welsh government's decision to lease the
The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected. Personal banking giant, XYZ Bank, announced today that their investigation into the recent fraud incident revealed that only 9,000 customers were impacted, significantly lower than the initial estimate.

Additionally, they have implemented additional safeguards to protect their clients' financial information and prevent unauthorized access to their accounts. While the reduction in the number of affected customers is welcome news, XYZ Bank acknowledges that even a single case of fraud is one too many.

It is essential that victims are taken seriously and that appropriate action is taken to address their concerns.

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a driving skills evaluation, and a customer service training course for all private hire drivers in the city. The move comes as part of TfL's efforts to ensure a high standard of service and safety for passengers. The proposed new requirements aim to address concerns over communication barriers and navigational difficulties faced by some private hire drivers. The English language test would ensure that drivers have a sufficient level of proficiency to effectively communicate with passengers, while the map-reading assessment would test their ability to navigate the city's complex road network. Additionally, the driving skills evaluation would focus on assessing drivers' awareness of traffic rules and regulations, as well as their ability to handle various driving scenarios. The customer service training course would aim to improve the overall passenger experience by providing drivers with essential skills in dealing with customers professionally and courteously. TfL believes that implementing these requirements would enhance the quality of service provided by private hire drivers, boost passenger confidence, and help create a safer and more efficient transport network in London.

Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing. The study highlighted concerns over the narrow focus of police officers, potentially leaving other vulnerable individuals at risk. The research, which remains unpublished, analyzed the practices of three unidentified police forces in England and Wales. It found that officers were dedicating a significant amount of time and resources to cases involving violence, while other risk factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, and domestic disputes were receiving less attention. Dr. Sarah Cooper, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of a more holistic approach in policing. She argued that by solely focusing on violent cases, officers may be missing opportunities to intervene and prevent harm in other areas of vulnerability.

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in the country's defense policy. The move comes as Japan seeks to redefine its role on the global stage amidst growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.

This marks a departure from Japan's long-standing pacifist stance, which restricted its military to defend its own territory only. The passage of the legislation has been met with mixed reactions both domestically and internationally. Supporters argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in global security, given the changing regional dynamics and the rise of new threats. Critics, however, express concerns about potential constitutional implications and the possibility of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts. The legislation will now move to the upper house, where
