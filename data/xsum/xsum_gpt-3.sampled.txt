Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the incident on 17 March. He is also charged with travelling at 93mph (150km/h) and failing to drive at a safe speed. The MoD said it was aware of the charges and said the case was a matter for the civilian judicial system. Judge Martyn Levett released the officer on unconditional bail to appear at Newcastle Crown Court on 7 June. When asked about the charges the Ministry of Defence said it was a "police matter", adding: "We will not comment further."
The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols that has intensified since an uptick in violence in Xinjiang in recent months. Members of the Uighur and Kazakh Muslim minorities have also been banned from entering the mosque in Hotan, a city in the southern part of Xinjiang, and ordered to drink alcohol during the holy month of Ramadan, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Sunday. Islamic religious schools and the teaching of Islamic religion to children under the age of 18 have been shut down and students and teachers have been sent to “study sessions”. In neighbouring Kazakhstan’s Ili Kazakh prefecture bordering Xinjiang, hundreds of men and women were banned from entering mosques and students have also been sent to “study sessions”. An estimated 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities live in Kazakhstan, many of them poorly integrated into the country’s ethnic Russian-dominated society. Residents are also banned from praying in “extremist”
Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. "It was an accident, obviously," she said. "There is no risk to the horse. He did it in his stall, and he did it in the dressing room. The vets say it's fine. "I wouldn't want to sound heartless and I am gutted to be fined £1,000, but I haven't done it intentionally, it's not a big deal for me. We didn't win the race, and it's not a race we would have won with or without it. It was a freak incident." Mullen will ride Cogry at Wolverhampton next week, while Cole, the William Hill young rider of the year, will partner another of her former rides, Pallasator.
Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College, south Wales, on July 28. But a jury of eight women and four men took just under an hour to unanimously find her guilty of causing actual bodily harm. After the verdict, a spokesman for the college said the A-level student involved in the incident has "continued his studies successfully" and is "well supported" by his tutors and his family. "The behaviour of the teacher concerned has been reviewed and action was taken to improve her performance and management," the spokesman said. Hungerford, from Treherbert, South Wales, was remanded in custody until August 10 when she will be sentenced at Merthyr Crown Court.
She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1989. The relatives of two of those killed were involved in a failed High Court challenge to the PSNI decision to send files on their deaths to the Public Prosecution Service. The police have said it is time to move on after a judge ruled they had acted lawfully in deciding not to reopen investigations into the killings. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told the party’s annual conference in Derry/Londonderry on Saturday that those responsible for the killings should be brought to justice. “People in the village want answers. They want to know what happened and they want to see those responsible held to account,” he said. “They don’t want to see this pushed to one side. They don’t want a culture of secrecy and cover-ups. They don’t want to see the murderers of their loved ones celebrated.” In a speech at the Londond
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had "fragile" staffing levels and needed to "implement a viable plan to increase officer numbers quickly" after inspectors found a force "worn down" by demand and squeezed budgets. HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said he was particularly concerned about the lack of officers on front-line response teams. "The service is close to breaking point," he said. The latest figures show there are fewer officers and staff in the force than at any point since 2003, while the force has fewer police vehicles than it had two years ago. The force has lost more than 3,000 front-line staff since 2010 and funding has been frozen in the past two years, causing some areas of the force to face real-terms cuts. The number of police officers in Avon and Somerset dropped from 1,683 in September 2014 to 1,589 in September 2015 - a fall of 4.3%. The number of police staff fell from 2,980 to 2,855, an overall drop of 3.
Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site, made of 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, is Northern Ireland's most popular tourist attraction, drawing more than 400,000 visitors a year. On the Royal couple's arrival at the Causeway Coastguard Station, the Queen was shown the centre's high-speed Rescue 123 boat. The couple then inspected the visitor centre, before taking in a view of the basalt columns at the nearby Chimney Stack, which rise to a height of 163 metres (535ft). Earlier, the Queen and the Duke had left Buckingham Palace in an open-topped Range Rover. The head of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, Fred Graham, escorted them on the first leg of their journey - across Horse Guards Parade in central London to Horse Guards Road and the Mall. They were then escorted by police outriders along the Mall and up Constitution Hill to Pall Mall, before turning onto St James's Street to pass the official residence of
The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and the London assembly member Jennette Arnold. IPPR research shows that the proportion of Londoners who are materially deprived is lowest among children under five. IPPR found that around 2% of children under five in London live in households with insufficient income for their needs, compared with 9% in north-east England and 8% in the West Midlands. But across all age groups, Londoners are worse off than those in the rest of the UK. The report says London's income poverty rate is 19%, compared with 13% for the UK. The IPPR, a non-party thinktank, called on local and central government to address housing and poverty problems. "The mayor, the local authorities and the government have a duty to the majority of Londoners who are in poverty," said the IPPR's research director, Anna Coote. "They need to start taking action."
North, 24, landed on his head after a high tackle from Adam Thompstone in his side's 19-11 defeat against Leicester Tigers on Sunday. Northern Ireland's three-Test autumn tour will come between the Northampton and Exeter games, which are set for December 1 and 8 respectively. Northern Ireland are expected to have four Tests during their three-match trip, facing Wales in Cardiff, Samoa in Apia and New Zealand in Auckland. With 50 caps for the Cherry and Whites, North joined Wasps from Northampton ahead of the 2015/16 campaign and scored eight tries in 18 appearances for the club in his debut season at the Ricoh Arena. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young told the club's official website: "We're all really pleased for George that he is going to be able to continue his international career and in doing so adding to his already impressive Test match tally. "He's had a great season for us so far and this extended period away from club rugby is a chance for him to recharge the batteries ready to go again once it's over."
Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Left-arm orthodox spinner Gulbis, who made his international debut in 2015, and 30-year-old left-handed opening batsman Bavuma are both uncapped in ODIs. The Proteas are currently top of the ODI rankings and set to play three ODIs and two T20Is in Sri Lanka in September. The team for the ODIs will be captained by Aiden Markram, while Faf du Plessis will lead the T20I squad. ODI squad: Faf du Plessis (capt), Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Robbie Frylinck, David Miller, Chris Morris, Lungi Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi, Khayelihle Zondo T20 squad: Faf du P
Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was "great news for the town and the wider East Riding region". "The government is absolutely correct to focus on investment in broadband," he said. "This is a real opportunity for Hull and the East Riding to strengthen its position in terms of connectivity and to develop a resilient and future-proofed digital infrastructure." “The announcement of this new fibre connection is fantastic news for Hull and the wider East Riding area. "This decision will open up new opportunities for our business community to further develop and grow their businesses and it means that we are on course to meet our Digital City agenda to develop Hull as a fully digital city. "Hull is a unique and dynamic city with a long history, and today's announcement will help us to further develop our digital infrastructure, cement our position as a global gateway to the world and help us move closer towards realising our vision of being an outstanding place to live, work, visit and invest." A spokesperson for the Digital City Taskforce said: "It
The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread "misinformation", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Meanwhile, the chief executive of the NHS in England, said the health service was "on the cusp of a disaster". But the Department of Health denied the claims. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The way the dispute is being handled could damage the health service, says Prof Sir Bruce Keogh Public Health England figures show there were 500 cases of norovirus in the first three months of the year - nearly twice the 250 cases for the same period last year. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's medical director, said doctors needed to talk to him about the best way to handle the situation - rather than strike. "I was talking to a senior doctor who said he had three or four emergency admissions with ambulances waiting outside in a hospital last night, patients being admitted to beds that were not ready," he told Andrew Marr. "That's what happens when hospitals are short of
The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker. As the South Korean company's shares hit a fresh low, we look at the potential damage to its bottom line. 1. Samsung loses potential iPhone customers Samsung is expected to lose $12 billion from lost sales of its Galaxy S7 flagship, according to Neil Mawston, a Strategy Analytics executive. Even worse, Samsung is likely to face stiffer competition from rivals in the high-end market, namely Apple, LG and HTC, who could possibly snatch some of its customers. 2. Samsung's share price plunges The South Korean company's share price has tanked nearly 10 percent over the past month, thanks to the Galaxy S7 snafu, making it vulnerable to a takeover. In order to raise cash for a buyout, Samsung should sell its memory chip or TV business, but it's unclear if it would be able to do so at an attractive price. 3. Samsung loses mindshare in China A model demonstrates a Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7
The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would allow expansion of the green minibus service and in-house training of new drivers, it said. Mr Baran’s office said the move would be a setback for the country’s campaign to tackle the greenhouse gases that are heating up the earth’s atmosphere. Even though most of the minibuses run on biofuel, Mr Baran said, it was still releasing between 50 and 90 per cent more greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. And the 15p price increase that the company wants would penalise poor passengers, he said. “Reducing the number of vehicles is going in the wrong direction,” he said. “They should be putting the vehicles on to smaller streets and creating a better public transport system in general.” Mr Baran said the Government should provide incentives for local authorities to create cycle lanes and link the separate minibus systems in Kampala to create a more comprehensive transport system. Despite
The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: "Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama Injured." The hoax came just minutes after Associated Press journalist Matthew Keys tweeted: "This is serious folks. White House press office is now warning reporters not to respond to this hoax email." It is understood the fake message originated in Turkey and was sent to thousands of AP journalists' personal email accounts. Earlier today the agency posted a warning on its Twitter feed reading: "This just in from AP's Twitter feed: BREAKING: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured." But the message was false and the tweets have been deleted. A spokesman for Associated Press confirmed the bogus message had been received by the agency's members. But it is not thought to have been issued to any member of the mainstream media. And the White House confirmed that Obama was safe and well, and said: "This is obviously a case of national security." A White House official
John McCormack drove for a further 30 miles in the articulated lorry after hitting the vehicle on the A9. Perth Sheriff Court was told there were suggestions that he had been drinking but there was no evidence to support that. It had been raining heavily at the time of the crash and Mr McCormack lost control as the lorry veered to the right before crashing into the work van. He will be sentenced next month.
In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Thursday in Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar. "As a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Philippines is committed to the principle of non-refoulement, which is the obligation of states to not forcibly return a person to a place where they risk being persecuted,” it said. "This principle applies to all persons, including refugees, asylum-seekers and undocumented migrants." It added that Philippine Foreign Secretary Yasay "will inform his counterparts about the situation in Mindanao" at the meeting. "He will also renew the call to strengthen regional cooperation to address shared challenges to peace and security, including the phenomenon of international terrorism," it added. The statement did not give more details on what measures it planned to pursue with the ASEAN member-states to raise the issue. Foreign Secretary Yasay said it was the third time since December that it had brought up the issue with China. "We would
"It's been a massive showcase for so much that's positive, strong and good about Wales," he said. Mr Crabb said the relationship between the UK and Welsh Governments was very positive. "I think that's an important part of it, that there's no negativity in that," he said. "There's a clear recognition that the UK Government is working closely with the Welsh Government, in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. "We want to put the Wales Office on a firm and lasting footing in the UK Government, alongside the Scotland and Northern Ireland Offices. "The Prime Minister announced a complete review of the workings of the Wales Office and how it fits into the Department for Work and Pensions. I'm confident we will deliver better outcomes for Wales and see this as a fresh start, looking at how we ensure a strong voice for Wales in the heart of Government." Mr Crabb spoke as an assembly committee said Wales should prepare for a "change in the way we view devolution". In a report, the Assembly's Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee said Wales needed to "brave the unknown
Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their device by voice. It's also capable of "speaking" in multiple languages, like English and French in addition to the default American English. It's easy to see how this could be helpful in Canada, where users frequently speak French to each other on the street. Along with its general functions, Google Assistant allows you to use the "eyes-free" mode to interact with your phone. By saying "OK Google" when the phone is in use, you'll be able to command the device to perform tasks, such as reading messages aloud. With Android Wear, Google's smartwatch software, the addition of Google Assistant makes it more convenient to use voice commands when your hands are busy. Jared DiPane/Business Insider While the feature is free to users, it won't work everywhere: you'll need an Android device running Marshmallow or Nougat in order to use it. Not every Pixel device is guaranteed to get Assistant
The election commission (Inec) said it hoped to announce the winner on Monday. The UN has praised the poll despite technical hitches, protests and a low turnout. Some 9.2m people were registered to vote in the capital, while some 4.6m had a chance to cast a ballot elsewhere in the country, officials said. Results were expected by late evening. On Monday morning, Inec Chairman Collin Mbogo said there had been no reports of major problems, despite late starts in some polling stations in Nairobi and other regions. Mr Kenyatta was among the first to vote at his local polling station, a school in Gatundu. Those who spoke to the BBC said they had voted for the incumbent to continue his development work in the country. Anecdotal evidence suggests that high-profile ethnic tensions have not played a significant role in this election - most Kenyans want to move beyond the bloodshed of the 2007 election and the numerous political crises since then. The leaders of some of the main parties - Mr Kenyans and Mr Odinga - voted in the north-east of the country
Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Pentland Hills on a day of good weather. The search, the largest yet mounted, was organised by Lothian and Borders Police after a team from Northern Ireland lost contact with two of its members and another civilian climber on 2 July. Family members were among those who helped with the search which involved search and rescue crews, dogs, two helicopters and a search plane. Mr Stewart's wife Sheila has made an appeal for people to take special care of elderly relatives after his death. Ms Stewart said she and their two children had been left heartbroken. "It's been very distressing and we are trying to help each other as much as we can," she said. "Geoff was always the most wonderful husband, father and grandfather." Ms Stewart said her husband, a retired vet, had been in the Pentland Hills since childhood. He and his brother had climbed regularly
Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 4.3 per cent. Public sector employment dropped by 23,000 to 5.88 million, while private sector jobs rose by 32,000 to 22.51 million over the period. ONS statistician Nick Palmer said: "Although total pay rose by 2.2% in the year to March, regular pay actually fell by 0.2% as an unusually high increase in April 2017, given to workers in the 'Queen's Diamond Jubilee' pay round, was not repeated this year. "A sharp rise in the number of people working part-time, combined with continued low levels of unemployment, meant that total pay growth was not as strong as some of the indicators of labour market tightness might suggest." Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: "The labour market continues to look pretty firm. "Private sector employment is little changed on the quarter and overall jobs growth is just a touch down on recent
Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. "When he explained who he was and his vision for me and what he sees for my future, I was very excited," he said. "He has a great background as a player and a coach. He knows what it takes to get where he wants us to get to and we are going to listen to his instructions and hopefully it can happen for me in that World Cup." The team made history when they qualified for their maiden World Cup, finishing as runners-up to West Indies in the 2015 World Cup Qualifiers, but Taibu is expecting tougher challenges in Australia and New Zealand next month. Zimbabwe play Afghanistan, West Indies, Ireland, Scotland and UAE in their Group A fixtures. "Afghanistan have a very good team, they play good cricket," he said. "Scotland will give us a big challenge and West Indies is always a great team. UAE is a great side, but we are very confident that we can win these games. I am really looking forward to the challenge and I
The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as "fuel shortage in a film", became France's top Twitter trend on Wednesday, with more than 12,000 tweets. Many social media users called for new taxes on fuel-inefficient cars and diesel to be introduced.
Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there were several reasons for the increase, including changes to Australia's visa rules and the fact that Australia was in the "final stages" of negotiating a resettlement deal with the US for asylum seekers currently in PNG and Nauru. "People smugglers, obviously, are having a crack, they are seeing this as an opportunity to peddle their product," Mr Dutton said. He said the fact that Australia has reintroduced temporary protection visas for asylum seekers arriving by boat was another factor, but "we're getting a number of boats, there's no doubt about that, I can't give you a precise figure". He said the two men, both Iranian nationals, were detained in separate "rendition" operations, one in Thailand and one in Sri Lanka. The pair, both travelling on fraudulent passports, are likely to be returned to their home countries after questioning. Immigration officials have contacted the two men's embassies. Fairfax Media revealed in May that the number of asylum seekers
The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in its first reading, with 275 votes in favour and three against. Mr Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006, and has lived in self-imposed exile overseas since. A verdict on whether to open an extradition case against Mr Thaksin is expected later this month. Over the weekend, Thai authorities released Mr Thaksin’s former wife, Pojaman, after she served nearly nine years in prison for fraud. Her case was widely seen as a political one linked to her husband’s ouster and allegations of corruption. Mr Thaksin’s sister, Yingluck, is now prime minister. In a controversial move, the lower house voted overwhelmingly to remove the prosecution of Ms Yingluck from the constitutional court. Her opponents had said that Ms Yingluck had abused her power in the awarding of contracts to her own company, Shin Corporation. She is not expected to benefit from the amnesty bill because her alleged offences occurred
Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to stabilise the sandy soils on the lochside. Meanwhile, volunteers have been busy undertaking a range of community activities including tree planting and litter clearing, and a festival was held in July in the village hall, where about 70 people enjoyed a day of music, food and games. Project officer Sarah Lyon said: “The festival was a great success and we hope to make this an annual event to bring the community together and raise awareness about wildlife and environmental issues, as well as to celebrate the area’s connection to Sir Walter Scott.”
Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to take a leading role in establishing a green financial system that would support technology and innovation as well as developing countries in their effort to fight climate change. He said: "German leadership in this area would be widely welcomed, but we should all be willing to play a role." The chancellor, George Osborne, has come under attack from environmentalists for cutting investment in clean energy and clean technologies. At a UN conference on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro last month, he argued that green industries had been given billions in state subsidies at the expense of business and tax payers. "I'm sorry, but a green investment bank in Germany does not make up for the fact that Britain is turning its back on renewable energy," he said. Germany's bank, which will be set up with an initial capital of €5bn, is intended to provide direct financial support to green projects from January next year. The bank's president, Hermann Otto Solms, said it would play an important
Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, remain at large.
The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote should take place after 2015. The manifesto, which was launched at the Wales Millennium Centre, said: "The Welsh Liberal Democrats will introduce a Funding Floor in 2018-19, after a referendum. "We will use the Welsh Labour block grant to ensure that the funding floor is set at a minimum level of £400 per pupil for every local authority in Wales. "This will amount to £150m extra every year." School funding will be devolved under a Labour government as part of Wales getting the powers to raise all of its own money from 2019. As part of its plans, the party says that its initial investment will mean no school would lose cash because of the policy. But Shadow Secretary of State for Wales Christina Rees said: "The fact that our manifesto pledges on school funding are even more vague and inconsistent than those of the Tories shows the dangers of letting them set the agenda. "These plans would see cuts in
Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. Europe’s top clubs now have the summer to consider whether taking on even weaker clubs makes sense in the modern game. There is no more reason to do it now than there was before the money poured in from the riches of the Champions League and its accompanying broadcasting contracts. The reasons were all in place. Great for our supporters, a different kind of challenge and a chance for young players to test themselves against top-class opposition. What harm does it do? Well, there is always the chance that someone does not turn up on the night, you don’t get the result you might want and you lose the right to compete in Europe for that season. It happened to us when Lyon were too drunk to play. It happens all over the world, and it is rarely commented upon by the other clubs. It’s all about priorities. Celtic have them, albeit with a different focus to the English, whose clubs seem to be determined to go after
It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another good example of this, with the announcement of Zipcar's expansion into bicycle hire. From April it's going to be offering bike hire in cities in the UK, US and Australia. This is how Zipcar describes the concept: "Hiring a bike from Zipcar is an ideal solution for those seeking a sustainable, healthy and easy way to get around town without traffic, parking or bike maintenance. Zipcar bike memberships are $8 per month plus $2 per hour with a three hour minimum. Zipcar bikes are fully equipped with a basket, front and rear lights and chain guard." Now I'm not saying I like the idea, and I'm pretty sure I'd hate a few things about it: the idea of losing all your local bike shops, the general loss of cycling as a mode of transport. I get sick of the corporate attitude of Zipcar, and the fact it's based on a model of car ownership, but ultimately I think the idea of a
Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. "We will prepare the event and we will host the 2022 World Cup," CFG president and Gabonese Football Association president Ali Bin Ali told African football delegates. "We have been preparing for it for a very long time. We already built the stadiums. We have what we need to host it." The announcement comes a week after Bin Ali revealed to CNN that Qatar had pulled out as the 2022 hosts. Qatar's supreme committee for delivery and legacy said it was no longer "the appropriate time for football in the region". Gift from president In 2009, the CFA had said it would build or refurbish six stadiums for the tournament to be staged in its biggest member countries. Gabon has one stadium -- the Stade de l'Amitie in Port-Gentil, which has a capacity of 30,000. In January, Ali said the country's President Ali Bongo had given the association three stadiums, "but
They spend an average of Â£581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly, they've never been on a festival that has broken its sell-out capacity (so it makes sense they invest in the good stuff), but there is one festival that they'd spend just about anything to attend. The top answer is Glastonbury, the world's largest greenfield festival which attracts around 170,000 people, and the second is Coachella, a four-day event that is held at the Empire Polo Field in Indio, California and attracts an attendance of about 75,000 people. So who makes up your typical festival-goer? He's most likely to be a 23 year-old-male, with a higher than average income and likely to be in a long-term relationship. He likes getting dressed up and going out, and isn't interested in making a friend. He likes wine over beer and will spend time in the bar at a festival more than he will watching the actual music.
The were 37 crimes recorded in Cromer over the weekend - including the rape of a teenager - with residents linking them to a group of travellers. Now police have confirmed that one of the travellers was arrested on suspicion of raping a 15-year-old in woodland off Wimple Road on the morning of Saturday, August 4. Police are not treating the incident as a hate crime. Following a meeting at Cromer Neighbourhood Watch the group’s founder, Kim Duffen, said that police said they had “hard evidence” which they hoped to use to track the suspects down. “Hopefully this will put an end to this sort of thing,” said Mrs Duffen. She said that the group, which has more than 1,300 members, would be increasing its presence in the area. The following day, a member of the group was involved in an altercation with one of the travellers. A Facebook message from the group said: “Due to a dispute with a traveller that happened on Wimple Road at 10.45pm on Saturday
The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone "flash past" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No immediate action was taken to investigate the sighting, but in a fresh report, seen by The Telegraph, the pilot warned the “risk of collision with UAS (unmanned aerial systems) should not be underestimated”. He also highlighted the increasing concern amongst fellow pilots that some drone users were unaware of the rules surrounding their use. GETTY An A320 pilot has spotted what could be the first evidence of a drone hitting a plane The pilot's report was included in a package of official evidence given to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) who last week published draft drone regulations. It has emerged that the "very unusual" sighting was witnessed from the cockpit window of the plane. It had taken off from Luton Airport and was headed to Palma in Spain. The report read: “Whilst on approach to Palma (S Mallorca) in daylight hours the First Officer observed a white drone-like device pass down the right-hand side
A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than a month off. A government campaign to raise awareness about the benefits of taking parental leave was aimed largely at mothers. It urged them to spend more time with their children, while trying to persuade fathers to take a more active role in parenting. Traditionally, men have stayed at their workplaces, while women left temporarily to look after children. The survey showed that while more than half of the new fathers said they believed that fathers should take more responsibility for childcare, they continued to place the primary responsibility on their wives. So many Japanese companies still demand that their employees must work long hours, sometimes well into the night, that some people think it is unrealistic to expect men to take a larger role in raising their children.
As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in the city centre. But the Parades Commission – the statutory body that regulates marches in Northern Ireland – ruled that there could be no stopping or standing of Orange supporters outside or in the immediate vicinity of the church.

The 34-year-old midfielder has just finished his latest spell in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. "Having been the first club in India to give an Indian the chance to lead a team, it feels great to be the first Indian to play for Atletico de Kolkata," he told ESPN FC in an exclusive chat. In fact, India became the first country in the world to witness the rise of an entire football ecosystem. In 2006, former France and Arsenal striker, Nicolas Anelka, set up a professional football club in India along with the Goan businessmen Shrinivas Dempo and Dattaraj Salgaocar. While the newly formed franchise based in the port city of Vasco da Gama, Goa, was named as Dempo SC, the commercial entity was christened as Goan Sports Club. The Kolkata-based franchise bagged the lucrative ISL (India Super League) rights for the inaugural season in 2014. It was assumed that the underprivileged players from India, who were plying their trade in Europe for years on end,
Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but a relative of the dead man believes he was murdered. A senior officer with Strathclyde Police said in a press report at the time that McLeod may have hit his head on a rock when he fell into the harbour. His death was put down to drowning.
Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair, both from Bamber Bridge, died after falling down the stairs of the Peacocks nightclub in August 2009. He was accused of ignoring the health and safety of customers by failing to take action to ensure staff on the door of the premises were properly trained. Eteson is also charged with failing to provide a safe system of work and is alleged to have failed to comply with building regulations. Today, prosecution barrister Paul Jarvis outlined Eteson's defence of 'no case to answer'. He said the defence team told the court the only allegation that could be argued to have fallen within the responsibility of Mr Eteson, who was the venue's manager at the time, was whether he had complied with the 1989 building regulation. Mr Jarvis said: "He (Eteson) has pointed out that it is an offence for a landlord, manager or his employees to fail to comply with the building regulations." But Mr Jarvis argued that
NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood types, and type AB negative can also be given to people with AB positive blood. A spokeswoman added: “People with type O negative blood are known as ‘universal’ blood donors because their blood can be given to people with all blood groups. “If someone has type O negative blood, it is very important that they tell us when they book to give blood because it’s such a precious commodity. “People with type AB negative blood are known as ‘universal receptors’ as their blood can receive red cells from any group.” To help people understand how to change their appointments or arrange donations at a different location, NHSBT is encouraging the public to use the NHS Donor Journey and to speak to the donor care team on 0300 123 23 23.
The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it was proposed would be made to Northern Ireland firms affected by the ESA. He said: "It was not possible to avoid taking this action as a result of the exceptional support already afforded to industry as part of the Stormont House Agreement. I would stress that we are committed to maintaining a strong and competitive supply chain in Northern Ireland and to ensuring that the local industry has the tools to secure a strong presence within a global aerospace sector." The decision to cancel the Â£1.1m payment follows the news last week that Bombardier had stated its intention to cut 1,000 jobs from its Belfast operation, which it said is its most cost-effective site in the world. Farry said that it was clear that Northern Ireland was not getting its fair share of the work, adding that there had been no evidence of Bombardier making a long term commitment to the province. "Given the size of the proposed cut in jobs,
The investment is backed by nearly £15m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said: "I am delighted to see this significant inward investment project has secured £14.9m from the Welsh government to support the construction of a £15.6m large scale project. With such a significant financial investment from Welsh government, this is yet another vote of confidence in the hard working team at Dragon Innovations and our local economy. I look forward to welcoming Dragon Innovations to the community and seeing what they achieve." The board of Dragon Innovations hopes that the factory will deliver a substantial economic boost to the region, with over 300 jobs created during the construction phase and then approximately 150 jobs at the factory itself. These will be manufacturing jobs that are expected to go to the people of Merthyr, which is very good news for a region that is currently at a difficult crossroads. In April, Wales' second largest town saw its last manufacturing plant, the 3M plant, close, spelling the end for 400 jobs. It is hoped that the presence
S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies will be a part of that as he has been appointed to the select committee for Culture, Media and Sport. Here he explains why he believes the current licence fee is “unfair”: “The current licence fee is unfair and we shouldn’t be afraid of saying that,” he said. “I think there is strong support out there for the licence fee being more proportionate. “I have no problem with the licence fee as a concept, it’s what is done with it that’s important. I don’t see how it is right that a licence fee payer in Ceredigion should pay for BBC programming in north east Wales. “I don’t think there is anything wrong with looking at the licence fee, it is a real possibility that we will need to do that. “It’s a real opportunity to do it because
The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also recorded for Scotland in April, although permanent demand still recorded a decline for a third consecutive month. More than half of firms (51 per cent) in Scotland recorded difficulty filling roles in April, the same proportion as in March. In Scotland, temporary staff demand grew for the sixth consecutive month, with the rate of expansion faster in April than in March. However, firms still reported a negative rate of change in permanent staff demand in April, continuing a trend since January. James Hick, Director of James Hick, Director of Markit Economics, said: "Employment growth in Scotland continues to outperform the UK as a whole, and it's clear that the economic recovery has translated into an improvement in the labour market, with Scotland seeing a significant pick-up in new staff. "Overall, the latest Markit/REC Report on Jobs suggests a strong labour market in Scotland, although some companies are still struggling to find staff. Temporary workers are proving to be
Envoy Sigrid Kaag was speaking as Syria appeared to miss a Sunday deadline to remove its arsenal from the country. All Syria's chemical weapons should have been destroyed by Sunday but reports said as little as 20% of the arsenal had been eliminated. Ms Kaag said experts had done a "remarkable job" under very difficult circumstances. Image caption Some of the chemicals being removed from Syria are put on a Danish vessel in Latakia "What is disappointing is that all the commitments that were made have not been met by the Syrians." The UK and US are among the nations taking part in the destruction process on board the MV Cape Ray. The OPCW says it will now work with the UN to determine what steps need to be taken in relation to the removal of the Syrian chemicals. When the plan to remove Syria's arsenal was put in place, President Bashar al-Assad had agreed to hand over to the OPCW all the production, mixing, filling equipment and chemical weapons munitions by 31 December. But this deadline was missed when the OPCW verified on

The 26-year-old, who plays for Seattle Reign FC, edged out the Republic of Ireland's Stephanie Roche and Canada's Kadeisha Buchanan to win the award. The honour is decided by a public vote. Washington, from Elk Grove, Illinois, scored a hat-trick in the US women's team's 5-2 World Cup semi-final win over Germany last summer. The four-time Olympic gold medallist is one of the best players in the world and this year she became the first American since 1999 to win the award. How does she do it? "I've always loved the game and I try to treat every day like it's my last," said Washington. "My personal philosophy on the field is to always give one more than what is expected of me, to bring energy and passion to the field and I think that I've been fortunate to do that throughout my career."

On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs. The aim of the match was to raise money for the "Daily Mirror" Christmas fund and the match was played at The Dell. Proceeds were split 50% to the charity and 50% to Mobbs who donated his share to charity. The match ended as a 3–3 draw with Mobbs' first game at full back for England and the last game of Percy Lawton's career. It was England's first match at The Dell since 3 March 1914. The "Daily Mirror" Christmas Fund match raised £275 for the fund. Mobbs had contributed £450.
The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. The government currently contributes £22m annually towards the upkeep of the sites. These sites, along with hundreds of others, will receive greater funding and new powers to improve standards of care and visitor facilities. Announcing the plans, culture secretary Sajid Javid said: “Our historic environment is one of Britain’s greatest assets. “A key part of this is ensuring we can pass it on to the next generation. “The new National Heritage Service will take forward a more joined-up approach to conservation and help ensure our historic sites are not just loved now but also for future generations.” ‘Greater scrutiny’ Julian Reid, chief executive of the National Trust, said it was “pleased” to be working with the government on the new service. “It is encouraging that ministers have listened to our suggestions for changes to the current system, which has fallen well short of its potential,” he said.
Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, before driving off to his farm on the Kintyre peninsula, with the body of her son, Ewen, 17, and setting fire to the car The petrol tank was also emptied, the jury was told. Kelly, a father of two, allegedly killed Dorothy and her son before having sex with her daughter, 19-year-old Melissa. But as her body was being cremated the next day, staff at the crematorium in Dumfries found a body - dressed in a white T-shirt, jeans and a pink vest top - in a bin. After an investigation police traced the body back to a wood in Bute - where Dorothy's body was found. Kelly was arrested and charged with three murders. During interviews he claimed to have no memory of what had happened and told police he had been a victim of sexual assault himself at the age of five. The double life of farmer Kelly was unearthed
A train travelling from Penzance to Exeter collided with another train on platform six just after 15.30 BST on 3 April. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the automatic warning systems which are in place at the station should have stopped the trains from entering the same track. Four people were killed and dozens injured in the crash, which has now prompted the government and regulator to investigate. The RAIB said it will look at all aspects of the incident, including staff planning, train and track positioning, driver involvement and communication, as well as platform signalling systems. This review should not take too long as Rail Accident Investigations do not normally take long. The information that will come out from this review may be information that the regulator and/or the government can use in the investigation of the crash. This may show any problems or bad practice that contributed to the crash. As all train crashes are a major worry to the public, especially those involving the safety of the staff, the regulators and the government will try to prevent another accident like this happening again. They will want to act quickly
The 71-year-old won 60.75% of the vote while his nearest rival Kizza Besigye took 35%, the election commission announced. Mr Museveni, who has held power since 1986, won the election with an increased majority, but it was lower than the 70% achieved five years ago. His critics say he has tried to strengthen his hold on power by clamping down on the opposition. Mr Besigye was detained at least 30 times during the campaign and twice faced charges of treason. He was also jailed during the campaign. The main challenger to the president took to the streets after he was excluded from a government-organised presidential debate earlier this month. Mr Museveni's main challengers were Besigye and Michael Kabaziguruka, the leader of the Uganda Peoples' Congress.

The retailer claims the plans for Chippenham would create 1,000 jobs and bring Â£31m into the economy each year. Meanwhile, Debenhams is to open a new department store in Warrington to replace the former Thistle shopping centre. It is the latest in a series of store openings by the retailer in the UK this year. Wolverhampton-based DSG International, which operates several retail brands, including Evoque, O’Neill, Warehouse, Jane Norman and Style Group, has been on a multi-million pound shopping spree in recent months. It announced earlier this year that it had bought retail brand Jane Norman and were considering possible acquisition of other names in the High Street. www.evodeal.co.uk Luxury department store Debenhams has today announced it is to replace flagship store Evoque in Warwick Street with a shop twice the size.Evoque, which opened in 2002, will close in July and Debenhams will move into the space
The 31-year-old tweeted she was turned away from a black cab and told to "find an immigrant" to give her a ride. She told London's Evening Standard: "I got into a black cab today and the driver told me he didn't have change. "I was a bit p***** off because he was implying I didn't have any, so I said, 'Well, I've got my card'. "Then he told me he couldn't accept card payments so I said, 'I've got a black American Express card, you've got to be able to accept that'. "But he said no, he couldn't. And then he said: 'If you have an immigrant friend, you know what to do.' "I just thought it was so inappropriate. I mean, I wouldn't have got into a car with him if I thought he was racist. "The next black cab I saw was driven by a black guy. We had a really good chat. He was so lovely and I tipped him." Blasting the driver for being
The deal for the 25-year-old World Cup runner-up is undisclosed but is understood to be about £8m. The type of deal City have negotiated means that a significant portion of the fee is payable only if Rodwell fulfils his potential, in the way Gareth Barry and David Silva have done since leaving Everton. Barry left for City for £12m on the same terms in June 2008 and the midfielder, who made only six league appearances for Everton after Rodwell, has gone on to win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups, as well as being England's most used player under Fabio Capello. Silva was sold to City from a Valencia in 2010, a year after Rodwell moved to Goodison Park, for £20m on the same terms and was also a relative success, twice finishing as the club's player of the season before being sold to Manchester City for £24m in July. However, Everton are clearly delighted to have secured such a high fee for a player they allowed to leave the club at 16 and hope the player now shows he can live up

Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits GBH. Aiden Frayne, defending, said Knight had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and would plead guilty to causing GBH. He told the jury: "On the night of the incident she had not been taking her medication and what happened that night was out of character for her." But prosecutor Elizabeth Reid said Knight had a "vast capacity to kill" and that she had been described as "a nurse who showed little mercy" by witnesses. The court heard Mrs Robson's injuries included an amputated finger, a number of cuts to her face and a punctured lung. A patient at the hospital described hearing shouting and crying in the early hours of the morning, followed by the sound of Mrs Robson screaming for help, the jury was told. Another patient saw Knight throwing an oxygen tank at Mrs Robson, hitting her on the head, before attacking her with a baseball bat, Ms Reid said. She
The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 local time (08:00 UTC) Thursday. Naro Space Center launch tower Liftoff was more than two years late because of technical problems, including a manufacturing error which mistakenly left two pieces of a fuel pipe misaligned. But Thursday's launch, which came after two delays, was nearly perfect. "All the engine valves were opened properly, the second stage engine ignited as planned, and the satellite was released into orbit as planned," a ministry official told the AFP news agency. Thursday's success puts South Korea in a small club of countries capable of building a rocket capable of carrying satellites into orbit. The success of the KSLV-1 puts it into a small club of nations that can design and build a launch vehicle capable of carrying a satellite into space South Korea's first attempt at a satellite launch ended in embarrassment after the rocket exploded in mid-air in 2009. It is still unclear if South Korea
He threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid failed, and the Football Association turned it down in April. Russian firm Evraz have bought 70% of the club, giving them a £200m holding in the club. But the FA has said it will only let them take the shirt sponsorship name if they make a statement on the future of the club. "We need the FA to give the deal its blessing as, having bought 70%, they will own the shares," said Levy. "All I ask is that they publicly acknowledge that this is a Premier League club that has been a member for 106 years and will continue to be a member. "I just want a simple statement of fact to put an end to this once and for all." Levy said on Wednesday that he would quit the club if the name change does not go ahead.

England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Ben Morgan. With just three senior cover forwards in Joe Launchbury, Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola remaining, Cokanasiga is likely to be called up alongside Don Armand, Nathan Hughes and Nick Isiekwe. "It's up to the coaches who they want to pick in the squad and the team, but my focus is on getting back to full fitness and being ready to play in the A team game against Wales on the Friday night," said Cokanasiga. "I'll have a nice few days training with England, and I'll be getting my conditioning and skills up to speed before I come back down to Bath on Sunday." The versatile back rower, who was born in London to Fijian parents, made his international debut as a substitute in the World Cup warm-up against France and played all five games during the tournament. Speaking before he signed for Bath, Cokanasiga said: "

The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four "de-escalation zones" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition group has dismissed the proposal. Image copyright AFP Image caption Images from Idlib and Aleppo show what appear to be Russian planes and air-defence missiles Russia has in recent days dramatically escalated its air campaign, saying it is targeting militants from the jihadist group formerly known as the al-Nusra Front in the country's north-western Idlib province. Rebels in the neighbouring provinces of Aleppo and Hama have meanwhile reported a large build-up of Russian forces. Video and images purportedly of Russian air-defence missiles in the country's north-western region have been posted online by activists. Russia launched its air campaign in support of President Bashar al-Assad's government in 2015. More than 300,000 people have been killed and half the population displaced since the conflict in Syria erupted in March 2011.
The country's Chamber of Deputies had already approved the legislation. The vote in the Senate, which backed the bill by just six votes, came after the upper house rejected a conservative amendment seeking to water down the bill. The Senate passed the legislation with 26 votes in favor and 20 against. The approval came after a debate that stretched over four days. It was approved in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, in April. The approval of the legislation ends a decades-long battle for the rights of gay and lesbian people. The bill, once it becomes law, will give gay and lesbian couples the same tax, inheritance and social security benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples. Currently, it is estimated that only 18,000 of the nearly 1.5 million same-sex couples in Brazil have made their union official. Same-sex unions are legal in the capital, Brasilia, and in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Espírito Santo, the Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará, Paraná, Piau
The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who are under police investigation over campaign donations. Mr Findlay, who won the top job in a ballot of the party's ruling body, said: "2016 has been a difficult year for the party but we are on the path back to recovery. "I'm proud that I have led our campaign for a fair voting system - one of the biggest political campaigns in Scottish history." He added: "2017 has started well for the SNP, with the opening of Scotland's first £50 million food bank-funded supermarket. And since last year's election we have seen the SNP winning more seats in council by-elections than any other party." The results of the leadership election are expected to be announced at the start of a general meeting of the party in Perth on Saturday. Ms Sturgeon is due to address party members in a keynote speech on Saturday. She is expected to highlight the achievements of the SNP's 56-strong group of
The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of next month's New York summit on refugees, Oxfam is lobbying world leaders to set a strong example. Four million people have been forced to flee their homes in the war, while at least seven million have been driven into destitution. “The refugee crisis is not an out of sight, out of mind issue – it’s about real people, forced to flee their homes by conflict,” said Moira Whimster, an Oxfam humanitarian policy advisor. “People around the world, including in the UK, are calling for Britain to show leadership on this crisis, with many saying we should welcome more refugees. Now is the time for Britain to step up and help share the responsibility with countries bordering Syria that are seeing the vast majority of refugees. “While refugee resettlement is only one small part of the response to the Syria crisis, it is an important one, providing protection to those in dire need and in doing so helping
The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with the Daily Beast in 2010. In a letter on the Newsweek website, editor Tina Brown, who also founded The Daily Beast, said: "We have been struggling to identify the business model that will allow us to innovate, but also survive. "This decision preserves the integrity of the brand, and will allow Newsweek to hold on to our identity and reputation for years to come." Over its long history, Newsweek has featured a galaxy of the greats, from Mark Twain to Susan Sontag, and provided a platform for writers and thinkers across the spectrum. Newsweek will continue its global edition, and its website will be updated with the best stories from the print magazine, alongside an archive. Ms Brown added that the digital side of the business had performed "far better than the print product, it is the most profitable part of the Newsweek enterprise". Newsweek's print edition has struggled in recent years, dropping to an average circulation of less than 350
Spencer Flower claimed his involvement with a social housing company was not relevant to a debate in 2013 over the future of housing in east London. Now the High Court has ruled that he did have a conflict of interest and has ordered him to repay £31,000 in fees received for acting as a director for the firm, MBIE Solutions Ltd. Mr Flower, 50, who has sat as a Conservative councillor in Waltham Forest for 20 years, gave evidence at the High Court during the case in January. He accepted that the council's solicitor had drawn up a formal declaration for him to sign when he took on the new role at the firm in June 2013. The declaration said he should not have any discussions with councillors or officers about matters affecting MBIE and that he must take no part in any decisions. But he denied that the potential conflict of interest was substantial. The court was told that at least two meetings took place with Mr Flower present as an elected councillor while he was acting as a director. No minutes were taken of the meetings or a

Entrants to the annual event have five minutes to tell the biggest and most convincing lie they can. Winner George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria, said: "I've told some elaborate lies in my time, but never anything as big as this one. It is considered to be the world's largest liar's competition. Some of the more recent winners include Doug Pigott who was awarded "world's best liar" by the World Liar's Club. Other well-known liars include Abanoub Boudhouda (world's best 14-year-old liar), Maarten Van Den Heuvel (world's best six-year-old liar) and Berislav Pusic (world's best liar of the year). One of the most popular categories is the "Dublin award" which is for the world's best telling of a really big lie.

Sales at the company rose to â‚¬34.2bn (Â£28.8bn) in the year to 30 June, from â‚¬31.7bn (Â£26.5bn) in the previous 12 months. But German-based Lufthansa, which owns more than 30% of Thomas Cook, said the firm had been hit hard by the credit crunch and high fuel costs. Shares in Thomas Cook were also hit by concerns that some of the travel firmâ€™s operations are more exposed to risks because they are handled in the UK. Chief executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa said Thomas Cook had been forced to suspend certain UK packages.

The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000. The abattoir was then purchased by former owner Andrew Emmett, with a 20 year lease from the council. He told the South Wales Argus that he wanted to invest £50,000 in the site, but the council told him that it was necessary to re-tender the contract to private operators. Emcol had previously declared bankruptcy in December 2015, after it was revealed that the plant’s previous owners, local farmers Andrew Emmett and Luke Millar, had been operating with a significant shortfall in workers’ wages. Emmett, a former farmer, had bought the Haverfordwest abattoir from the council, and then sold it on to Millar and his brother Lee, who both run farm shops. An investigation by the government’s Red Meat Regulatory Office (RMRO) found the farm had failed to pay workers for at least nine months before Emmett became involved.
Ben Purdy, 18, was shot in the head in Bermondsey after confronting his girlfriend's ex about "threatening" messages sent after their break-up. The teenager was hit in the head from close range in broad daylight as he was waiting for his girlfriend outside her house in Mouldsworth Road at 3.50pm on December 8 last year. The shots were fired from a black Vauxhall Astra and the gunman fled north along Stainer Street. Mr Purdy died in his girlfriend's arms minutes after they were forced to lay him on the pavement to administer first aid. Officers launched a murder investigation after discovering he was the victim of a targeted shooting. Detectives launched an appeal for the "heavily-built" ex-boyfriend of the 17-year-old girl to come forward. The appeal prompted a reaction from locals who said they had heard rumours the teenager had threatened Mr Purdy over Facebook. Cheryle McKinnon, who is friends with the boy's mother, claims he bragged about threatening Mr Purdy on social networking

The old way of going to a gig and seeing who else is at the same gig, or watching a concert on TV or online, is still a great way to find new artists and new music. And, of course, record shops. But Spotify has been the latest online way to find music for many years. It offers songs, not albums, for download. The site says it has '40 million tracks' in its library, which people can listen to for free. If you pay for
Heading the processions were some of those caught up in the suicide bomb attacks on Belgium's airport and metro station that killed 32 people. Belgian flags were held aloft as, in the arrivals hall, a young woman named Samia stood with a placard which read: "Je suis aussi musulmane." ("I am also a Muslim") People around the globe have been showing their solidarity with Belgium in the aftermath of Tuesday's attacks. 'Je Suis Bruxelles' An image of a man holding a heart made out of nails while standing next to a sign that reads "Je Suis Bruxelles" (I am Brussels) has become a symbol of Belgium's resilience in the wake of the attacks. Solidarity in other languages The words "Je Suis Bruxelles" have been scrawled in English, French and German, among others, across social media. "Ich bin" A mock "I am" campaign has sprung up on Twitter, in which people say they stand with Belgium, followed by their
The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two discoveries in the area in 2007 and 2010, has already undertaken two exploration drilling campaigns on Kadanu. “We are pleased to be able to announce our first drilling results on Kadanu, which confirms the size and quality of the previously announced structures and the potential for extensions to them,” explained managing director Tim Collier. Results from the first well, the K1 sidetrack, showed significant evidence of oil shows while drilling. A total of 34 feet of oil-bearing sandstones were encountered at the two levels which were targeted. “The presence of multiple oil-bearing reservoirs in K1 and K2 adds further value to the prospectivity of this area,” he added. Senegal’s government granted the project rights to 10 percent of any oil and gas revenues and 40 percent of the royalties. “The evaluation work to be undertaken in 2012 will be focused on confirming the well defined structures on
Tear gas and live bullets were fired to drive back the mainly Shia Muslim crowds, as they protested against corruption and security failures. Officials imposed a citywide curfew and arrested 200 protesters. The violence was in stark contrast to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, where uprisings have been led by the middle class. "What happened here has proved that the cause is not just economic, but political and social as well," said Hadi Jalo, one of the protest organisers. The protesters said they were not part of the elite but believed that the US-backed leaders, both Shia and Sunni Muslims, were corrupt and were failing to deliver services to the public. Similar demonstrations were also staged in the northern city of Mosul and Falluja, a Sunni city in Anbar province which has witnessed attacks on US troops and the Iraqi government. Protests had been staged in Baghdad last month by hundreds of people calling for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government to be removed and reforms introduced.
Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty in July of encouraging terrorism. Detectives from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit's Counter Terrorism Unit found the Al Ghurabaa organisation used its website, as well as DVDs, CDs and videos to encourage people to go to Iraq or Afghanistan to fight against British troops. The group raised more than £1,000 a day and on one occasion they tried to raise £50,000. Police confiscated computers, DVDs and CDs after raiding a number of premises across the country. Fourteen people have been convicted of terrorist offences in 2008 including two other Islamic preachers. Last month, Judge James Spencer jailed Osman Hussain, 21, from High Wycombe, Bucks, for three years after he admitted raising money for terrorist groups. After Hussain was arrested in January by police, an officer posing as a Muslim told Hussain that he wanted to be a suicide bomber. Hussain said: "You can't find a more glorious way of dying

The 24-year-old judo competitor was taken from her flat in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood on the western edge of the city. Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada says authorities are investigating. Scotland's Sports Minister Shona Robison called the news "sickening". Spiteri's parents, Gillian and Martin, said they were "delighted and relieved" to have their daughter back.

Remus Hamza, 40, is alleged to have attacked the 20-year-old near Cardiff University as she walked home alone after a night out. Miss Stewart, who was wearing a skirt, jeans and a light top, needed 30 stitches after the attack on Friday, February 27. Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard Miss Stewart was treated in the city's Royal Infirmary where she had skin grafted from her legs. She was released on Monday and is recovering at her family home in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire. Hamza, from Roath, Cardiff, also faces a charge of breach of the peace and was due to go on trial yesterday. But Miss Stewart said she was "too scared" to give evidence against the suspect and was not in court to give evidence. Hamza made no plea to the charge against him during a brief appearance yesterday and will go on trial in September. He is accused of biting the woman and placing her in a headlock during the attack. The trial is expected to last for five days. Ham
Helen Bailey, 51, was found dead in a cess pit at her house in Royston, Hertfordshire, in July 2016. She had met Durrani online and believed he was a businessman called Bob. He befriended her online in 2013 and as he became controlling, she sought help from the police, who told her he was a fraudster. Bailey bought him gifts and cash, withdrew money from her accounts to give to him, had his name added to her accounts, bought him a car and even went to Afghanistan to visit him.

In April, he was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey and jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years. Another man, Lukasz Pawel Herba, had admitted the killing. He was jailed for a minimum of 30 years. Herba, a Polish national, met Bailey on a dating website, but after becoming
The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: "We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American." Trump replied: "We need this question - this is the first question." To which the supporter said: "But anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?" Trump's comments came after he said President Barack Obama could be described as "the founder of Isis". The GOP nominee also took aim at Obama's failed Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who, he said, had a "wrong policy with Isis".

Mr Corbyn has declared that "six months is a very short space of time", and that he expects more progress in the time that remains. It's a message he also delivered to his shadow cabinet - particularly those who had served in Mr Blair's governments, who he said should have been making an effort to go out and say to the electorate: "We've got things to say."

The bodies of backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found on a beach close to the southern resort of Koh Tao on Monday. They had both been bludgeoned to death. Yesterday the families of Mr Miller and Miss Witheridge made tearful appeals for the couple's killers to be found.

That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said. Advertisement Advertisement (Chart: IEEFA) The researchers said the funds spent on fossil fuels are “staggering and are likely not sustainable over the long term”, and pointed out that the money is being invested instead of distributed to governments as tax revenue. A total of US$2.8 trillion was spent on global fossil fuel subsidies in 2013, equivalent to US$10 million per minute. This is despite rising fossil fuel production costs. On top of that, taxpayers in G7 countries are also being hit by G7 subsidies to oil, gas and coal production, totalling US$88 billion per year, the report found. "This not only contradicts the Paris commitments, but also flies in the face of broader international trends to cut back on fossil fuel subsidies," said IEEFA director of energy finance studies and co-author
Falcon and Pointer was fined £175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined £125,000 for making automated calls promoting roofing services. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) also took action against a company that bombarded a GP practice with nuisance texts and calls. Royal Assurant Ltd (RAL) was fined £120,000 for an “extensive and repeated campaign” of direct marketing and unsolicited calls to GP practices. The company sent over 11,000 text messages, with one text message received by one of the GP practices on an average of every five minutes for almost three weeks. “My office will not tolerate nuisance calls or texts from companies, and this case shows that we will not hesitate to use our enforcement powers against repeat offenders,” said Steve Eckersley, ICO head of enforcement. “Companies of all sizes need to make sure that their marketing practices are ethical.” While the latest fines might seem small compared to the average PPI compensation payout
The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked by the private security firm ISS, which runs the unit. The Health Ombudsman, Sir Liam Donaldson, is investigating their sacking. A spokesman for the ICO said the two nurses were among 10 people who have reported the health trust to the organisation and were to be paid £1,200 in damages. Lynn Gough, one of the joint general secretaries of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, accused the ICO of being too heavy-handed. She said: "This could become a serious problem for the ICO. It has set a precedent. It could be challenged on the grounds that it is a severe threat to free speech and association." An ICO spokesman said it was possible that any injunctions obtained by the Royal Liverpool would not be valid in future if they broke the law by employing public sector workers to check records without getting the consent of all patients.
Charles Blackman's oil work Women Lovers features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it at $A26.7 million, before withdrawing it from auction. Credit:Mossgreen Several paintings by Australian artist Russell Drysdale, including some in the National Gallery of Victoria's collection, were taken down and sent for restoration. Drysdale's farm shed studio in the Yarra Valley, where he produced many of his paintings, was damaged by fire in the 1940s. “We’re very particular about preserving these sorts of things,” says Michelle Teran. “It was a good experience to clean and conserve them properly.” The Drysdale paintings are going back up, as well as the oil on canvas by Blackman. There will be a three-month window for a buyer to purchase either of the artworks, or the gallery will give away one of them for free to an arts organisation of its choosing. “The first option is to sell it, but we’ve seen in recent times that the market is really fluct
The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set at the height of the Cold War, is being adapted by the Oscar-winning writer of The King’s Speech. It is one of several of le Carré’s books that have been filmed, including The Constant Gardener, adapted by Fernando Meirelles. According to The Hollywood Reporter, le Carré’s book about Cold War espionage tells the story of former agent Alec Leamas who is working as an agent in East Berlin when he learns his contact is being sent back to London. He tries to sabotage the operation but it fails. When he is sent back to Britain himself, he is asked to try to discover what happened. He discovers an alleged Soviet double agent who, he is convinced, is a British informant. As a result, the agent is murdered in cold blood. The book won the 1964 Edgar Award for best first novel and was made into a 1965 film starring Richard Burton.
OUP analysed more than 120,421 short stories by children aged between five and 13 years old, submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. According to LENA, boys write, on average, just 25 more words than girls – a tiny difference – so the company tried to find out why. The study, entitled The Science of Storytelling, shows a sharp gender divide, in terms of storytelling, when boys and girls reach the age of 11, with girls preferring to write fantasy, and boys more likely to write in other genres, such as science fiction. The study also analysed the most common topics of short stories submitted to the BBC’s 500 Words competition, the UK’s biggest children’s writing competition, and found that, overall, girls’ short stories revolve around romance, and family, whereas boys’ stories are more often based on science fiction and fantasy. The study included students from 25 schools in London and Birmingham, where the children wrote short stories, to an adult audience. These were sent to LENA for analysis. Girls' Stories more often focus on
The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no offer on the table. Crisis? What crisis? Three points was all Bristol City, who had seemed all but doomed earlier in the season, needed to be sure of Premier League football next season. And if that point had arrived in Tuesday’s 1-1 home draw against Brentford, the team and the fans wouldn’t have cared if Clough did not turn up to the final game of the season. While the late arrival of the birthday boy didn’t exactly prompt chants of “There’s only one Brian Clough” in the 18th minute of the game, some fans were in a forgiving mood – especially when Bristol City went two up at half-time, thanks to Gary O’Neil’s own goal and a Wes Burns penalty. To be fair, Cloughie did put in some work when he took over. His task was to steady the ship and deliver a stable
The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the "non-appointment" service will help doctors to "treat the patient, not the clock", and provide much needed access to healthcare in the evenings and at weekends. Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of NHS England's new primary care service, said: "Primary care is under pressure from an ageing population, rising expectations, greater complexity of disease and rising staff costs. "Primary care clinicians are the lynchpins of our health system. They play a pivotal role in patients' health, and we must therefore protect and support them. "We hope that these new services will be welcomed by patients. And we would encourage the public to use them to help us tackle the challenge of seven-day working." Patient feedback will help to shape the service over the coming months, she added. Also on HuffPost:
The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a "growing threat", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano erupted at 05:57 GMT on Sunday spewing smoke, gas and rocks into the air, Japanese officials said. Sakurajima, on the western coast of the southern Japanese island, has been erupting since early April. Scientists say the growing activity of the volcano is because of the eruption of an underground magma chamber. Sakurajima has been experiencing volcanic activity on and off for decades. It has not had a large eruption since October 2007 when a similar event to that on Sunday happened. The February eruption forced more than 250 people living near the volcano to flee their homes, but no injuries or deaths were reported. In April, Sakurajima was hit by dozens of smaller quakes. Sakurajima is more than 4,900m (16,000 feet) high. It is part of the larger Sakurajima volcano group, which also includes Mount Kuchidake. Nearby towns and villages have been covered in volcanic ash from previous eruptions.
The girl, who has Smith-Magenis Syndrome, was arrested four times and twice held overnight in police stations. Her mother complained about her arrest, and authorities, including the U.S. Justice Department, launched investigations into the arrest. The officer involved retired. His identity has never been released by Pottstown police or the Montgomery County district attorney's office, which conducted an internal investigation into the matter. The Montgomery County district attorney's office had no comment Monday afternoon. Contact information for the Pottstown Police Department was not immediately available. The lawsuit was originally filed in 2014, but was suspended until the results of the investigations were complete. Smith-Magenis syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause delayed development, speech difficulties, and learning disabilities. According to the Foundation for Smith-Magenis Syndrome, the disorder is present at birth, but "the full extent of the health concerns, cognitive and physical limitations are not always clear at that time." The syndrome has been linked to a number of behavioral disorders including sleep problems, anxiety, and temper tantrums.
PC Frances Tilley admitted she had "destroyed her career" after evading payment for a journey between Bristol Temple Meads station and Castle Cary in September 2015. Instead, she claimed to have travelled from Portsmouth. 'Prolific offender' However, an investigation by rail operator South Western Railway (SWR) revealed she was in Bristol for a period before and after the journey. Tilley, from Horfield, who has been a SWR employee since 2003, appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court and admitted the offence. Her case has been referred to a disciplinary hearing and it will be up to her employer to decide what penalty she will face. Rail regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said: "This has been a particularly serious case where an employee of a train operating company knowingly created an inaccurate record of a journey that had been paid for by the train company. "Her conduct shows a blatant disregard for the law and her employer's policies." The ORR added that Tilley was a "recalcitrant offender" and
Rachel Miller has paid "brokers" up to Â£7,500 a time to free sex slaves. She travelled to parts of southern Europe which she believed were still being "inundated" by "women, girls and children who are being smuggled into this country in the back of lorries". Often she and the "debt-bonded" women and girls were taken to the British border by their "controllers", freed and then advised by the border police that they were seeking asylum. Ms Miller says: "I became a volunteer to assist trafficked women, who as a rule come to the UK with the belief they will be given jobs and lodging in return for working as prostitutes. "When they refuse they are kidnapped, raped, kept prisoner in their country of origin or locked up and abused in the UK by their controller or trafficker, raped again, beaten, threatened and sometimes even killed." Once in the UK, however, they receive scant support from the authorities because many are ashamed to admit that they have been trafficked, or are afraid of "returning

After beating 90,000 other gamers at an event in London, he was flown to the U.S. to try out for Nissan's U.S. team. He survived a three-day boot camp in Spain to join an elite three-man team, and placed fifth in the world in his first season in the driver's seat of a Nissan GT-R.

Officers at first did not treat Stephen Phillips's death as suspicious after he was found in his Wolverhampton flat. His family became suspicious when they received a number of calls from companies they had not dealt with in the past, each claiming the 28-year-old had failed to pay bills and was behind with payments. They discovered he had a bank account with £20,000 in it and had been offered an apartment in Dubai by his employers, but would have to go immediately to get it. Tania, 38, said: "He wouldn't have gone because he would have had to walk away from all his other commitments, such as his girlfriend and his mother." She believes he was lured to his death by another employee who worked on the same project as her brother. "They killed him to avoid him talking about what had happened. It's sad but it's true," she said. The family handed details of their suspicions over to police. An inquest into Stephen's death on 20 October last year has not yet been held. Det Insp Dennis McKeever, of West
Mrs Foster said on Wednesday that she wanted to better understand those who love the language. She said she wanted to "listen to and engage with as many people as possible" on the issue. After a day of criticism, Sinn Féin said it had been wrong to suggest Mrs Foster had opposed an Irish Language Act. "There is an onus on us as politicians to be honest with people," Mr Adams said. "And if there is an issue, if there is a disagreement, then we have to say so and not pretend it doesn't exist." Mr Adams said he would "like to thank the many people who have raised this matter with us and who have spoken out on this issue. "I am very clear that this is a dialogue we need to have.

Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him "significant pain and discomfort for the past number of months". The Gunners say he will now be able to "take a full part in all training programmes" and also "participate in the latter part of the pre-season programme, with the club hopeful he will be available for the start of the Premier League season". Spanish international Arteta made 21 Premier League appearances last season as Arsenal came fourth in the table and won the FA Cup, and has made 145 appearances for the club since arriving from Everton in 2011. Midfielder Wilshere, 21, is yet to feature for Arsenal this pre-season following the knee injury he sustained at home in February. The England international made 34 Premier League appearances in the 2012-13 campaign, having been out for 17 months from September 2010 with a stress fracture of the ankle. Arsenal manager Wenger has said he expects Wilshere to be back in full training by the end of next month.
The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used for teaching and training purposes. It could be used in the classroom for science lessons to show chemical compounds, or in hospitals for doctors to consult digital textbooks or review x-rays, for instance. The team is now working on further reducing the size and cost of the system. They also hope to add more functionality to the device, such as facial recognition and a built-in projector that can display images and words directly on a surface.

The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of "buildings as power stations". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University and the Natural Resources Institute (NRI). The aim is to build a 50m² prototype house at Specific's site. "Specific has been working with Swansea University and Tata Steel on this innovative and exciting project," said managing director Chris Smith. "This is in the early stages of development and we look forward to working with other businesses and research centres to deliver innovative, cost-effective housing of the future." If successful, the concept would help meet the needs of the future UK, where the demand for housing will exceed the available land supply, while not hindering the decarbonisation of the UK energy system. Up to 40,000 new homes are currently built in Wales each year, and the project will develop innovative approaches to maximise the use of steel in new build homes, enabling up to half of the planned future carbon reductions in the construction sector to be met. An in-depth feasibility study will be undertaken before a decision is taken whether to take the
Erika Murray, 31, was arrested on Thursday night after a neighbour alerted police over the safety of other children living at the house. Detectives found her son Daniel, 15, inside the property. A post mortem revealed he had died from malnutrition and neglect. Neighbours, including an off duty police officer, said they had called the NSPCC, Leicester city council and the NHS out of concern for the children living in the house on several occasions, but no action was taken. A team of more than 30 detectives has been assembled to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Daniel in the small terraced house in the city’s Bosworth Street on 27 January. On Thursday night, following a tip off from neighbours, police went into the house and found the body of Daniel Murray inside. Officers arrested his mother Erika, and her partner, 40-year-old David Rawcliffe. The couple have lived in the house for around six years. In an interview on Friday, Erika Murray’s mother, Janet Smith, said that her daughter had experienced difficulties with her mental health
The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded Cure the NHS campaign group, said she had "definitely been told" that a Stafford man had hanged himself last weekend because of his treatment by the NHS. "There is a woman who lives at home on her own. She has health issues. She told me, 'We tried to call an ambulance for her, but we couldn't get through. So we got her in a car and took her to the A&E, and we waited over two hours before we were seen by anyone. This is not acceptable.' "These are not isolated incidents. These are not isolated failings in the NHS. And because they're not isolated it's because of managerial failure, because the system isn't working. "There are lots of things happening in other areas and it's not just in Stafford. It's right across the country. But it's because of the same issues, it's because of money and because the system isn't working. "What I
Yorkshire batsman Joe Root has been named as new Test captain after Alastair Cook resigned after more than four years in charge. "We have a duty of care to all our players and we feel we have to protect our players in all formats". This is a very responsible decision on Cook's part, and the press conference afterwards made it sound as if it was a unanimous decision. In the 22 years since Cook's debut, just two England captains have won more Tests: Nasser Hussain, with 55, and Bob Willis, with 28. Root had been seen as a key figure in the development of Yorkshire's young bowlers, particularly former county captain Liam Plunkett, in a hard year for the county's red ball prospects. "(But) I've got a huge amount of respect for the way he goes about things". Sky Sports are predicting a potential change to the batting order, with Jason Roy returning to the top order and Jonny Bairstow returning to number three - something that was tried during the winter with him batting at No. 3 in the India series and Roy batting at
Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin ships since Aug. 30. The shipping industry is worth about $345 billion, according to shipping services company Drewry Financial Research Services. Hanjin accounts for about 7.8 percent of global container shipping capacity, and another filing by the company could further disrupt freight traffic, according to the South China Morning Post. Hanjin may be the largest bankruptcy in the container shipping industry, but it is not the only company in financial trouble. South Korea’s Seaspan (SSW), a company partly owned by Blackstone Group (BX)’s shipping fund, filed for protection from creditors in May. Seaspan agreed to pay a committee of creditors 40 cents on the dollar owed, and Drewry said in a research note that at least 15 more Korean companies are potentially bankrupt. Container shipping companies need to compete with rail freight to get goods from ports to their final destination. Containers used to ship goods are increasingly loaded directly onto
Buckingham Palace announced on Friday evening that the Queen would not attend because she had gastroenteritis. Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan Byron Davies was named in her place. The Investiture, which marks the official naming of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales, was held at Caernarfon Castle in July 1969. The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh have previously attended Investitures, but not since 2007.
The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year. A probation report three months earlier had stated that his mother had "no concerns" about him. In court today, Jetha's counsel told the judge that the report had not taken into account the background of the child's family and their financial situation. However the judge told him that the victim's mother had clearly stated to police that there were no concerns about her son's safety and well-being with Jetha. The judge said she could not ignore the fact that the offence happened at his home and that the girl had been left there overnight with no one there to check on her. The judge said that in the pre-sentence report she had learned that Jetha had come to this country for a better life and that he now has a good job. She said it seemed that he had benefited from coming to Ireland and that it was clear from his pre-sentence report that he is a "sensible and decent person who would not have planned a brutal
They began their trip by travelling to the Seamus Heaney Homeplace Centre in Bellaghy, where they met members of the poet's family and visited the Heaney Homeplace Barn, where he wrote many of his poems. The youth group later moved on to the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry and at Ashbrook House in Toomebridge, where they heard from the Centre's manager, Diane Forde, and began their walk from The Gates. The students, aged 15 to 19, then went on a walk in Lough Beg, where Seamus Heaney visited frequently as a child, and ended the day at Ebrington, visiting the library, Seamus Heaney statue and taking a tour of the 19th century fort. A spokesperson from Seamus Heaney said: "The teens really loved the visits and they said it was an amazing experience, hearing about the famous writer from his own home to the library where he and his family members used to read and write. "The group finished off with a visit to the 'Field of Light' at Ebrington before
The H3 project combines back office services at four police, fire and council authorities in Hampshire and Oxfordshire, to save up to £5m a year and make their public services easier to use. The new merged organisation will have fewer IT systems and data centres, but provide a single online access point for citizen services. "For the past few years we have been using a lot of the same processes and having the same conversations across all our authorities," said Gillie Kearns, assistant chief constable at Hampshire Constabulary. "We decided it was time to start working more collaboratively and set up a project that can work with all three of the other partners across the police, fire and council." Gillie Kearns, assistant chief constable at Hampshire Constabulary The project began in 2012 with a review of all of the existing IT systems used by the police, fire and council. For example, an online application for a special events licence, which can be quite complex, can now be done using the same online portal regardless of the different police force or council the organisation is dealing
The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a “huge mistake” if any further steps were taken to reduce the number of foreign students. The figures for the Home Office showed a 72% rise in the number of EU citizens, from 85,794 to 154,108, from 2005-06 to 2010-11, with Indian students making up 29% of the total. A total of 201,911 EU students were granted entry in the last academic year. In comparison, during the last financial year that ended in April 2012, immigration officials rejected visas for nearly 60,000 students. Students have a higher rejection rate for their visas than any other group. Separate figures from the ONS also showed that British citizens working abroad earned £22bn in the year to April 2012 – the highest level on record – helped by the strength of the pound. The £22bn is an increase of £6bn compared with the previous year. The figure has been boosted by earnings from the roughly 400
The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be given the opportunity to stop using them and receive refunds on unused balance. The organisation's executive director of strategy and competition, Christopher Woolard, said: "Customers who fall victim to unarranged overdraft charges are, typically, financially vulnerable and many receive a shock when their bank debits their account, often leaving them unable to pay for essential living expenses. "Despite this, we have found widespread poor practice in the way banks and building societies set up unarranged overdraft charges. "Our concerns have centred on firms making it too easy for their customers to fall into an unarranged overdraft and making it too hard for them to climb back out of it." The FCA identified a number of potential issues and has ordered firms to review them: – Customers' opportunities to repay overdrafts on a manageable basis; – The effectiveness of firms' processes for setting the cap on unarranged overdraft charges;
Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his decision to run for a third term in office. His move triggered street protests and an armed uprising by some of the country's most prominent civil society groups. The unrest escalated into a conflict in which at least 800 people have been killed, and more than 230,000 displaced. Amnesty International has said that at least 25 of the deaths were the result of unlawful killings by security forces. Sectarian attacks in the country between Christians and Muslims have also become more frequent. blc/gsw (Reuters, AFP)
Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it "difficult to control his emotions" and "somehow finds it easier to use force rather than to say no to someone." The court was told yesterday Dr Green also diagnosed him with dependent personality disorder which "means he seeks to be cared for, to have others take charge of him, and to be in a relationship with someone who will take charge of him". A local community worker who grew up with Mr Butler told the court yesterday she did not believe he had changed. "It's not in him to change. I've known him since he was nine or 10. He's a very hostile person," Sandra Whelan told the court. The sentencing will continue today. robyn.dorey@news.com.au
The furry feline has been a familiar face on the steps outside Number 10's black door since he moved in, in 2011. And the PM is said to be very fond of him. "It was just something that the Camerons took a liking to," the source revealed. "They have made friends with him, and he gets on well with Larry." So, how would Boris handle the devious feline? One can only imagine. Read more: Nick Clegg has taken over Larry the cat's Twitter account
The fragile piece of wood is all that remains of the Nanteos Cup, a wooden chalice named after the mansion in which it has been kept for hundreds of years. The historic cup, from a little-known Christian sect, is revered by scholars for its elaborate carvings and evidence of Celtic and Christian cultures blending into one. It is believed to have been carved in the 17th century in England before being brought to Wales, according to Bryn Hammond, the local historian who bought the cup from a private collection last year. Story continues below advertisement "I am really fearful for its safety. I think it's a hugely significant thing in Welsh cultural heritage and national heritage," said Mr. Hammond. "The cup is in a state of danger and we have to do something about it." He worries that it could disintegrate if it is left in the hands of the British government, which could see it scrapped or remain in its current state of neglect for years. "This cup is the last trace of a lost Welsh Catholic Church. If it's not
Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. He is a nonagenarian. -King Charles ‘second’ victim- On Wednesday, the authorities filed another suit in which they asked a court to award them the money demanded by Charles Mumbere. Mumbere’s relative, the king of Aba, Leonard Mumbere, and the Aba city administrator, were among those targeted in that case. The new suit said, “On Wednesday May 14, 2015, King Charles II celebrated his 80th birthday at his palace in Rwengurugu village.” “Mumbere conspired to celebrate his birthday, knowing that he was suffering from hypertension and diabetes. “He consumed a large quantity of food, including ugali, and large amount of bai (white maize beer), without taking precautionary medicine,” the suit said. “He proceeded to dance and entertain people in the presence of
These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were photographed in Kenya's Masai Mara Game Reserve by a group of scientists studying animal behavior. Researchers believe that the cub was a wild orangutan, which had been captured by local hunters. They brought the young primate to the Mara as an offering to the female lioness, who had lost her own cub to starvation. In an incredible act of compassion, the lioness allowed the baby orangutan to feed from her. It is not known how long the baby orangutan and lioness remained together. Experts say the orangutan was likely killed for food by local villagers. 'I knew from experience and knowledge that female lions, as well as males, will take other animals' young if they are desperate,' explains researcher Roger Burrows, from the University of Helsinki. 'The lioness lost her cub and within a week was taking the baby orangutan. She treated it as if it were her own.' These images
Evha Jannath, 11, was on a school trip on Tuesday when she fell from a circular boat on Splash Canyon at Drayton Manor Park, Tamworth. Police said her family were still coming to terms with the "tragic" death. An investigation has begun into the incident which happened at around 13:20 BST. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: "Despite extensive efforts to resuscitate the girl, she was pronounced dead at the scene." A West Midlands Police spokesman said: "Police and ambulance were called to Drayton Manor Park shortly after 13:20 following a report a girl had fallen into the water while on a school trip. "Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death and have been carrying out enquiries to identify the girl's next of kin." 'Comfortable' Melvyn Davies, the park's general manager, said staff were helping the girl's family. "It is with deep sadness that I have to report that a young girl tragically lost her life at Drayton Manor Park today
The holders, who also won the trophy in 2013, bowed out in the group stage despite six wins in 14 games. Promotion in the County Championship was subsequently scrapped, with the winners instead now only gaining an extra licence point and prize money, and the bottom club in Division Two relegated. The ECB last week proposed a new County Championship format, with play-offs and more Twenty20, in its new strategic plan, but those plans have already faced fierce criticism. Cook believes the new one-day tournament will help develop young English players for all three formats of the game. "A number of us feel strongly about this competition," he said. "One-day cricket is something we have been talking about in the dressing room for years and we have to be a lot better at it. We have to find players who have the ability to play the short form of the game. "This is the ECB's opportunity to get it right, to pick guys who are up-and-coming in county cricket, who have the potential to play the World Cup in 2019, and that is really exciting
The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will be reduced to 2.75 percent from 3.25 percent, and the two-year to 2.25 percent from 2.75 percent. "The Russian economy has reduced its reliance on external factors and proved resilient to recent adverse changes in the global economy and financial markets," the regulator said in a statement. It added that "inflation risks have increased somewhat due to a more pronounced weakening of the ruble." The ruble has tumbled against the dollar as oil prices have plummeted, reaching multi-year lows in recent days. Crude is a major source of revenue for Russia, and the fall in oil prices has seen the ruble shed almost a quarter of its value against the dollar. The central bank also announced that it would cut the discount rate, which is the rate banks can borrow from the central bank, from 10.5 percent to 9.5 percent. "The situation is more or less under control. The regulator took
The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called "bearer bonds". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy clients to make transfers anonymously. "We took a prudent approach to address potential criminal issues that may have involved some of our clients. We are confident that we are in full compliance with all laws and regulations that apply to us, and we continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigations," a UBS spokesperson said. UBS suspended certain client accounts in May. Whistleblower Bradley Birkenfeld has claimed that the bank's branch in Geneva was a key conduit for illegal cash into Switzerland. In 2007 Birkenfeld provided the US government with details of illegal practices within the bank, leading to investigations in the US and Switzerland. After speaking out Birkenfeld was sentenced to more than three years in prison. He is due to be released on July 3 and has been pardoned by the Swiss government.
The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The donations were allegedly made in exchange for policy favours. Mr Lee also denies two other charges of abuse of power and giving false information. He was arrested in February 2017, three months after his term ended, and has been in custody since then. The trial began on 6 April and was initially expected to take a month. But the court adjourned for a 10-day break on 11 May, and the proceedings were suspended for a further seven days on 28 May. When it resumed on 4 June, the court took another week off. The reasons for the delays were never made public, although some observers said the proceedings had been deliberately slowed down by the prosecution. Legal experts say this could be because the government wants to keep Mr Lee in custody to prevent any future political upheavals. If convicted, the former president will face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase without needing to visit a separate website. The company's chief business officer, Omid Kordestani, first mentioned the service, which could let consumers purchase items using their Google Account credit cards, last week. "Google is trying to reduce the friction of online shopping by making it easy to buy things through Google search," a Google spokeswoman said in an email. Google is not the only major online company trying to make shopping easier through its product. Yahoo unveiled a similar program for searching for products in the U.S. this month, allowing customers to find and buy items that way. Yahoo and Google had previously worked with other companies to provide this service. The new Google service will be run through Google Product Search, which lists information about products and links to e-commerce sites. Google users searching for items like a new iPhone can click the "buy" button that appears on the search results page. From there, they can place the order directly, rather than searching for and navigating to an online retailer's site. The "buy
The Black Caps, having been set a world record 504 to win, resumed on 142-3 and their challenge quickly folded. Brendon McCullum (4) was quickly bowled by Graeme Swann, Ross Taylor was caught at long on for 21, Kane Williamson was lbw for 32, and Grant Elliott was caught behind for a golden duck. Chris Martin followed, before Daniel Vettori was lbw to Anderson. Anderson then wrapped up the match with his fifth wicket, having Grant Elliott caught behind to finish with figures of 5-35. Anderson had also dismissed Vettori and Martin for ducks in New Zealand's innings. In the shortest format of the game, the Black Caps were set 196 to win in 20 overs in the second T20 international at Old Trafford on Saturday. The Black Caps' biggest hope for victory, Nathan McCullum, was dismissed first ball, and by the fifth over they were four wickets down with only three runs on the board.
An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid rent since November 2014. The lease runs until 2053. However, the Welsh Government said it "does not comment on private negotiations". A spokeswoman said: "The Welsh Government has a strong track record of achieving good deals for Wales in relation to aircraft procurement. "In order to retain control over our procurement and ensure that we get the best deal for the public purse and Wales, as a matter of policy we do not comment on any aspect of commercial arrangements that are a private matter between ourselves and any supplier." Shadow economy minister, Russell George, said the "facts are indisputable". "The Welsh Government got an unbelievably bad deal from the first PFI contract in 2004. We have an utter mess and another blow to the economy," he said. The assembly committee said Cardiff Aviation should not benefit from the contract if it fails to meet its obligations, and the Welsh Government should seek to recover any lost rent. Meanwhile,
The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected. Personal details of around 9,000 account holders, including some phone numbers and addresses, were stolen in the data breach, Tesco has said. The data that may have been compromised, which came from a small percentage of Tesco Bank's overall customer base, is thought to include names, some bank sort codes and phone numbers, and the date of birth for some customers. This is in line with the data held by Tesco Bank about current account holders, but does not include data from credit cards or account history. No PIN numbers are thought to have been accessed in the data breach. The data breach occurred when a criminal gang were able to penetrate Tesco's security systems. In a statement, Tesco said: "The first stage of this incident involved fraudulent activity against a number of Tesco customers who used their credit or debit cards at self-service tills in Tesco stores. This was immediately contained and the police informed." Tesco Bank said in a statement
The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The incidents occurred while she was living in separate accommodation but she said she was frightened and nervous about seeing him in her area. Hutsby was arrested and questioned by police but no further action was taken. When he was arrested again in November 2014, police were shown photos of Hutsby holding a gun, ammunition and a knife. They interviewed him and discovered he had a cache of weapons and explosives at his house. Detectives searched the house and found an assortment of homemade guns, including a high-powered self-loading rifle with a silencer. They also discovered more than 300 rounds of live ammunition, another gun, air rifles, and knives. Police experts carried out a series of tests on the weapons. They found the rifle was so powerful it could bring down an aircraft and kill everyone inside the cockpit. Experts also discovered Hutsby had constructed a live hand grenade by filling a tin with explosives and shrapnel. Officers seized the weapons and explosives and H
Thomas, 28, is a key member of the Team Sky side trying to guide Chris Froome to a second successive Tour title. Froome has won all three stages so far and sits comfortably atop the general classification standings. "I would love to ride the Tour, and I think my legs are good enough," Thomas told the Telegraph. "I've always said I think my style of riding could do well in the Tour. I would love to give it a go, but the team have a responsibility to put Chris in the best position, and he's not going to back off. He's going to be fighting for that yellow jersey." Thomas may be one of Sky's best bets to support Froome. The Welshman has six wins this season, most notably in the Tour of Romandie and the Eneco Tour. He also placed third in the recent Paris-Nice stage race, a sign of how much form he has at the moment. The talk that he could focus on the general classification at the Tour began immediately after that event ended. Thomas talked of "an ambition" to ride the Tour
Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a good behaviour assessment and another on how to safely use the roads, under the proposed changes. Those applying for a private hire licence must currently pass a written knowledge test, a speaking test and a geography test to obtain their licence. But Ms Dexter said: “Our evidence suggests that even those who pass the current tests are then not fit to drive.” Licences are currently awarded on a four-tier system with a basic badge, a badge requiring a car, a badge with a higher standard of car and then a certificate. TfL will consult on plans to require more stringent tests for drivers in higher bands to get higher quality cars and ensure they are “properly trained”. “This is so that only drivers who are capable of driving safely are allowed behind the wheel of London’s famous black cabs,” Ms Dexter said. Driver attacks on other taxi drivers are also included in the
The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Downing and Romaine Sawyers. However, Darius Henderson's control allowed him time to shoot low past Lee Camp from 15 yards and give Walsall their first win in five games. Scunthorpe manager Mark Robins: "For the first 15 minutes of the second half it was as bad as we have been since I've been manager. "It was a much better performance in the first half than we had put in on Tuesday and I think we deserved to go in at half-time ahead. "Our problem is we have been short of goals all season and that's why we are where we are. Our win against Blackpool is the only time we have won back-to-back games and we have got to make that happen more often." Walsall boss Dean Smith: "I think we deserved to be ahead at half-time and that's why I was frustrated. "But we took the lead through a quality strike from

Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are using technology to identify such factors by cross-referencing criminal records against historical data. However, such data is patchy, with too few recorded offences, which means its ability to predict future offending is limited. Sir David also flagged up the need for new police recruits to have a broader skills base. Officers are increasingly finding themselves having to talk to vulnerable people – those with alcohol or substance misuse problems, mental health issues, or drug users – and would benefit from additional training in these fields. He said: "The more complex the problem you have to solve, the more likely you are to need different skills in order to solve it. Recruitment into the police has always been focused on physical ability, but physical ability alone doesn't solve very much. This is about giving officers a tool kit so that they're able to be adaptable and solve a range of problems." The College of Policing is working with other organisations to develop training for officers,
The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be approved by the upper house on Friday.
Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, set off to climb the Fansipan mountain alone on 3 June. He called his girlfriend to say that he had reached Camp One. He was found dead on 6 June. "Aiden had come to see me before he went and I explained to him the risks," an emotional Mr Lawrence told the BBC. "He wasn't stupid, he knew the risks, he knew it would be tough, but that's why he wanted to do it. "He was doing something he wanted to do. He wanted to get up there. It was hard but he got to Camp One. That's what he set out to do." Mr Lawrence described his son as a "mild-mannered" person and an "athletic, tall lad" who was used to high-altitude climbing. "You try and prepare yourself as best you can, but if something like this happens and it's a freak accident - you can't prepare yourself for it," he said.

The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982. It went on to sell millions of copies of the game, which involves a small character called ET collecting items and avoiding obstacles. By 1983 the video game market crashed, but copies of ET continue to sell on eBay for hundreds of pounds. "I've got some good contacts who have been up there. The site is just strewn with all sorts of stuff," Jason told the BBC. "It's at the end of the runway, covered in snow and you've got to have ropes to get in. "The guys that have been up there have come across Star Wars memorabilia, guitars, ET games, computers, cars, motorbikes, snowmobiles. Anything, really." He says he is in negotiations with several film companies to allow him to go back up to the site and get the material down. He said the owner of the site "doesn't want anything to do with it", adding that the
Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and businesses were shut when major flooding hit Stoke Newington, Blackheath and Islington. Sadiq Khan has promised to review the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime's flood response plan in light of the latest severe weather. He announced an additional £42 million has been allocated to SELNEC area for this year and next year for the repair of flood defence assets. This comes on top of an extra £25 million in May 2017 and a further £47 million in July 2017.

The European Challenge Tour event will be part of a big week in the season with both the US PGA Championship and Women's British Open also taking place. The 2013 edition of the Wales Open, Europe's only PGA TOUR affiliated event, produced a number of first time winners. Englishman Marcus Fraser took the spoils in 2013 after a play-off with Stephen Gallacher and Australian Cam Smith following a final round battle for the line, and the event will again be held at the Celtic Manor Resort in South Wales. The 2014 PGA Championship will be staged at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. There is a new venue for the Women's British Open in 2014, as the event will be hosted by Royal Birkdale Golf Club. The Lake Karrinyup Country Club in Perth will play host to the 2014 Australian Open Championship. Europe's premier junior event, the Volvo World Match Play Championship, will once again be held in Spain at the Club de Campo Villa de Madrid. The European Tour will kick off in Turkey with the Turkish Airlines Open at Regnum Carya Golf Club on the
Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the weapons, the defence ministry said. The weapons had arrived from Switzerland and were to be returned. The consignment did not contain any ammunition. It is the fourth reported raid this year on shipments in transit. "This incident will have consequences. The deployment of troops (to the airport) has been reinforced. We will work in the coming hours to understand how this could have happened," Armed Forces spokesman Colonel Martial Tanguy told Reuters news agency. The seized weapons include four assault rifles, including two with silencers, and two machine guns, the defence ministry said. The weapons are used by the infantry but also by some special forces in Mali, according to Reuters. The attack took place at Douala international airport, one of two serving Cameroon's capital. The airport was temporarily closed after the raid. No group has so far said it carried out the attack. Military officers killed Some of the officers killed were based
The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with apartments and a park In recent weeks the final remaining privately owned property, the Lyndhurst Park Hotel, has been purchased and plans have been submitted for the building’s demolition to make way for apartments and a park. Earlier this year the council won a Transport and Works Act Order to authorise the construction of the £93 million, half-a-mile long, twin-bore tunnel connecting the Blackwall Tunnel to the new Thames Tunnel. Speaking on Monday, the mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “I have been really pleased to see the transformation that is taking place in east London as we unlock the potential of the Thames. “The construction of the new Thames Tideway Tunnel and the other major infrastructure projects in the area mean that there will be major improvements to the network of footpaths and cycle routes connecting the park and the surrounding area to the Thames’ foreshore.” The mayor also praised the recently
