Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was "awful" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as "twitching" and "may have been aquaplaning" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. "There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong
The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency
Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. "It was an oversight," Palmer told BBC Sport. "The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables." The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. "I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken," he told BBC Radio Berkshire. "There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules
Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been "unacceptable". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: "The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again." Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the "provocative and disruptive" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had "acted in an inappropriate way" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the
She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. "Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner." The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. "It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein," she said. An Alliance
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had "fragile" staffing levels and needed to "implement improvement plans rapidly". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was "out of date". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be "requiring improvement". Inspectors, who said the force would be "monitored closely", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as "fragile but improving" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. "There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues," the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in "an affordable way more quickly" while ensuring its service "remains effective". However, they
Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as
The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of "tests" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the "stark" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director
North, 24, landed on his head after a high tackle from Adam Thompstone in his side's 19-11 defeat against Leicester Tigers on Saturday, 3 December. "I read some reports he must finish and stop playing. He doesn't want to be treated like that," Mallinder said. "All George wants to do is get back and play rugby." The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scarlets winger will sit out Northampton's game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day because of the incident, despite saying he was not knocked out. "He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious," Mallinder told BBC Look East. "That's not saying that he was not knocked unconscious briefly. If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand
Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. "Maybe, maybe not," he told BBC Sport. "I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time." Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan
Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was "great news for the town and the wider East Riding". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. "The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy," he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. "It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition," he said. "I think that a few people felt it missed out
The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread "misinformation", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are "unfair". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's "shambolic mishandling" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: "One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. "They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't," he added. "We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you
The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker. As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States. European markets are scheduled for October. 24 August: The first report of a Note 7 device "exploding" appear in the news. It isn't long before there are more incidents with users posting pictures and videos of what they say are their phones overheating, exploding or catching fire. 2 September: Samsung announces a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, citing faulty batteries.
The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be "dangerous and reckless" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public
The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: "Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured." US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: "The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false." The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: "The
John McCormack drove for a further 30 miles in the articulated lorry after hitting the vehicle on the A9. Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: "To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. "They managed to get off the road onto the verge. "The lorry missed them, but unfortunately it continued on and a couple with three children in their car weren't so lucky." Ms Kynaston said that the lorry hit the offside of the car and scraped along it. She said: "One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel. "Police managed to pull over the lorry further down the A9. This had been going
In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would "discuss within the context of
"It's been a massive showcase for so much that's positive, strong and good about Wales," he said. Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked "remarkably well". He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: "We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. "We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. "And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. "Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all
Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with apps and ask questions. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. Google's update will starting rolling out this week to users with Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat installed. "With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant," said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, in a blog post. But other virtual assistants are out there. At the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona, Lenovo Moto revealed that Amazon's Alexa assistant would be coming to the Moto Z phone. This will happen via an alternative back - known as a MotoMod - that Amazon will sell for the Moto Z later this year. And at the CES tech show in Las Vegas last month, Chinese tech giant Huawei announced it would include Amazon's rival Alexa assistant on its phones. Google Assistant differs from its competitors slightly in that it
The election commission (Inec) said it hoped to announce the winner on Monday. The UN has praised the poll despite technical hitches, protests and violence linked to Boko Haram. Voting spilled into a second day in some parts of Nigeria after problems with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a "huge national embarrassment". The Inec chair, Attahiru Jega, stressed that only a fraction of the 150,000 card readers being used nationwide had failed. The vote had been delayed by six weeks because of the insurgency by Boko Haram militants. Unpredictable poll Nigeria decides 2015: Full coverage The Islamists attacked polling stations in north-eastern states, with a curfew declared in Bauchi State after fighting between the security forces and the group. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the "determination and resilience" of Nigerian voters, despite the reports of attacks by
Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Southern Uplands on Tuesday. Police said he died late on Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier on Wednesday. A third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, remains in hospital. A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: "Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time. "Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary." The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday. Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility. When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50
Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: "The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. "With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off." Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April
Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. "When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax," Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon said. "The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us." The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. "It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda," Gordon said. "I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' "This guy has
The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as "fuel shortage in a film", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared
Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a "growing threat" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in
The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. "The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders
Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a "large and vibrant habitat". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a "bumper crop" of acorns they began planning to collect them. "We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate," he said. "The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. "By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. "This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future." The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are
Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. "In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted," he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. "The development of this new global asset class is
Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. "He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of
The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an "expectation", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them "over a barrel". The manifesto states the Conservatives would "introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: "The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. "The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next
Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. "I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "It just shows that what we have done has actually brought us two spots." Signeul pointed out that the Netherlands, who will host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in a 20 October friendly in Livingston, only have one team in Europe's top club competition. "It is all based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously," she pointed out. Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. "It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in
It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off Â£49 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and
Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. "We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017," said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. "We have decided to play and win the cup." Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. "Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012," Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. "I think we won the bid
They spend an average of Â£581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the "superfans" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these "superfans" help to "drive the music festivals market", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend Â£45 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming "too corporate". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend
The were 37 crimes recorded in Cromer over the weekend - including the rape of a teenager - with residents linking them to a group of travellers. Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was "no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter
The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone "flash past" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a "collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that "something had just gone over the top of him" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object was red and white in colour, had red and blue stripes on two of the rotor arms and was under a metre in size. All drone operators are required to observe Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles which require a person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft to only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied the flight can safely be made ,and not to recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft
A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed "ingrained" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. "The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles," said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. "Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave." He said there remained a "cultural expectation" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding
As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. "The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held," it said. "The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city." North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: "The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of
The 34-year-old midfielder has just finished his latest spell in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. "Having been the player who has come back three times before, I know the appeal and why you would want to come back," said McFadden, who confirmed that Well have made him an offer. "And I know Pearo is exactly the same." Pearson began his career at Fir Park and, after spells with Celtic, Derby County, Bristol City and Karela Blasters, rejoined Well for a season in 2015. He is a free agent again after helping Kolkata finish fourth in the Indian league before winning the title with a play-off victory over his former club, Karela. "We have spoken to him and offered him a deal and we're waiting to hear back," said McFadden, who thinks Motherwell have a tradition of welcoming back former players. "Pearo would be a great addition on and off the park here. "We would love to him back, so hopefully he makes the right decision and comes back. "I know he has one or two things to think about before he makes that decision, but he knows he will
Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of "all information known" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment "turned up nothing new" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out "in recognition of the continued impact" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and "their desire for a conclusive outcome". He said: "Our sympathies remain with
Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to
NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive
The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training
The investment is backed by nearly £15m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would "safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years". "In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales," she said. "Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce," she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than £2.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from
S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a "special case as it promotes the Welsh language". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel "within the next couple of years", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: "The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language." Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. "These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important
The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT
Envoy Sigrid Kaag was speaking as Syria appeared to miss a Sunday deadline to remove its arsenal from the country. All Syria's chemical weapons are scheduled to be destroyed by 30 June. The Russian-US deal to eliminate Syria's arsenal was drawn up last year after hundreds of people died in a sarin rocket attack outside Damascus. Destroying Syria's chemical weapons Syria chemical weapons removal plan The multinational mission to get rid of the weapons is overseen by the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. "The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site," Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine
Media playback is not supported on this device The Seattle Reign player topped a supporters' poll to become the second winner of the BBC World Service award. She beat a shortlist of Gaelle Enganamouit (FC Rosengard, Sweden), Amandine Henry (Olympique Lyonnais), Carli Lloyd (Houston Dash) and Becky Sauerbrunn (FC Kansas City). "I'm surprised to win, I'm extremely humbled to win," Little, 25, said. "Women's football is in a great place. Hopefully it will progress further." Little received the award at her club's training ground on Tuesday. Mary Hockaday, Controller of BBC World Service English, said: "Well done to Kim Little. It's been another outstanding year for women's football and Kim's talent shines through on the pitch. "I'm delighted BBC World Service plays an important part in giving female footballers the recognition they deserve." Little was Seattle's leading scorer, and second overall in America's National Women's Soccer League, with 10 goals as she helped the Reign top the league in 2015. She also played on

More than half of the men's world's top 10 pulled out of competing at Rio 2016, citing the Zika virus. Briton Justin Rose, one of a group on four under, hit the first ever Olympic hole-in-one on the par-three fourth. "There is always an element of luck but you could chalk it up as a good hole-in-one," said Rose. "I won a car that time [his last hole-in-one] but this is definitely better, better bragging rights. When you are the first to do something no one can take that away from you. That was definitely a cool moment." Newly crowned Open champion Henrik Stenson is tied for second with Canada's Graham Delaet on five under. Rose is one of five men tied for fourth on four under; along with Belgium's Thomas Pieters, Gregory Bourdy of France, Alex Cejka of Germany and Spain's Rafael Cabrera Bello.

On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs. The aim of the game had been to recruit sportsmen to Mobbs's World War One battalion. The commemorative match will take place on 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club. It will see players from the East Midlands region line up against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while Olney Ladies will face the Army Women's XV. Edgar Mobbs •Born in Northampton in 1882 • He played his early career in Olney and became captain of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907 •Selected for England in 1909, he scored a try on his debut against Australia and went on to win seven caps •He went from private to battalion commander. fighting in Loos, Somme, Arras and Messines •Mentioned in Despatches twice, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order •He died while charging a German machine gun during the battle of Passchendale on 31 July 1917 Having retired from rugby in 1913 aged 30, Mobbs was refused an officer's commission when war broke out because of
The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. The government currently contributes £22m annually towards the collection. The aim is for the charity to eventually become self sufficient. Other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded. The new official body, which will also advise on planning, has a working name of the National Heritage Protection Service. The new charity will still be called English Heritage and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection - which include London's Kenwood House, and Charles Darwin's home in Kent - will remain in public ownership. Government funding for the charity will be tapered down from 2015 eventually to nothing, meaning it will have more freedom than now to generate income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations. Some of the £80m awarded by the government will help to set up the charity so it will be fully operational by March 2015. In a statement, the government agency described the planned changes, which will be
Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, on 22 May. The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made "derogatory" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing. The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal Â£300 from his victim's bank account. The victim's body was
A train travelling from Penzance to Exeter collided with another train on platform six just after 15.30 BST on 3 April. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch initial findings found the signaller believed there was enough space for both trains on the platform. About 35 people were injured. Read more on this story as it develops throughout the day on our Local Live pages The report said: "Allowing trains to share a platform is known as permissive working, and is allowed for passenger trains using platform six. "The signaller could see the rear of the train from the signal box window and estimated there was enough room for the moving train to fit on the platform. This was not the case." One of the trains was moved to platform six due to passenger lifts being closed for maintenance on alternative platforms, the report said. While approaching Plymouth, the moving train accelerated to about 21 mph and went through a relatively tight, left-hand curve. That is when the driver saw the rear of the stationary train on platform six and was surprised to see it so close to the west end of the platform.
The 71-year-old won 60.75% of the vote while his nearest rival Kizza Besigye took 35%, the election commission said. Mr Museveni's supporters said his opponents had failed to offer any chance of progress. But Mr Besigye, who is under house arrest, said the results were a "sham", calling on the international community to reject them. "We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda," he said in a statement. EU observers have also criticised the poll, saying the governing party had created an "intimidating atmosphere" and that the opposition alleged vote rigging. While praising the "remarkable determination" of Ugandans to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's "domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media
The retailer claims the plans for Chippenham would create 1,000 jobs and bring Â£31m into the economy each year. However, of the five candidates vying to become the area's MP, one is totally against it and three admit to having questions over the proposed site. Petitions for and against have been signed by thousands of people locally. Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan said she could see both sides, but believes the consultation - which has now ended - was inadequate for something that is "dramatically going to change the town forever". The application for the 72,000 sq m regional centre is yet to be discussed by Wiltshire Council, but the five candidates gave their views during an election debate recorded for broadcast by BBC Wiltshire. Andy Newman, for Labour, said he was in support of the development and had been assured it would bring in 700 permanent skilled jobs and would "push up wages in the area". In contrast, Green party candidate Tina Johnston
The 31-year-old tweeted she was turned away from a black cab and told to "find an immigrant" to give her a ride. The alleged altercation comes after she apologised "on behalf of my country" over squalid conditions at the Jungle camp in Calais. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said it condemned abusive behaviour. The singer wrote on Twitter: "Just tried to get in a black cab with my kids. The driver looked at me and said 'find an immigrant to drive you you stupid tart'." She went on to add: "Having lived a life of privilege, that interaction has given me a tiny glimpse of what it feels like to be discriminated against." Her claims have been questioned by some. One Twitter user said it "definitely didn't happen", while another asked her to reveal the taxi's registration plate. She wrote they were "victim shaming" her and replied: "I had both my hands full with children, couldn't get to my phone fast enough." The association, which represents about
The deal for the 25-year-old World Cup runner-up is undisclosed but is understood to be about £8m. The type of players that we try and identify to come in here are ones that add quality to the squad and he definitely will do that Fernandez joins on a four-year contract and should be included in Swansea's squad to face Burnley on Saturday subject to international clearance. He started four of Argentina's games during their run to the World Cup final. Fernandez comes in after manager Garry Monk moved to replace 27-year-old Chico Flores following his switch to Qatar. The centre-back revealed his delight in joining the Swans after getting advice from Michu. "It has always been my dream to play in the Premier League - it is the best in the world - and I'm grateful to Swansea for giving me this opportunity," he said. "I asked Michu and Jordi Amat about the club. I obviously trained with Michu at Napoli and while I was on loan at Getafe [in 2013] I played with Alvaro Vazquez. He is very good friends with Jordi, so I've spoken to
New shots of Charlene Downes, 14, who was last seen in Blackpool town centre, were discovered during a trawl of CCTV. Her body has never been found. Her mother Karen said she was "disgusted" the footage had only just been found after years spent investigating the unsolved murder case. Lancashire Police said it "understood" Ms Downes' views. Nobody has been convicted over Charlene's death. The footage has been released on the anniversary of Charlene's 2003 disappearance - as part of the forces "longest" murder investigation. Ms Downes said: "What I can't fathom is why this [the footage] was never found in the previous investigation. This is the bit I'm absolutely disgusted with. "At the same time I'm happy with the footage and now hopefully they [the detectives] can move forward and we can get some answers. "I want closure now... We can't move on with our lives and it's just terrible." Det Ch Insp Richard McCutcheon said: "I can understand [the family's]
Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits administering the insulin. She told told a jury at Oxford Crown Court she did it so that she would not be discharged from hospital. Ms Knight also denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent. She told the court she wanted her mother to remain cared for and not be sent home. She said: "I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. "It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would." She admitted she told a series of lies to police in January when she was questioned. The court heard she had a forged a prescription for insulin, which she had collected at a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When asked by defence barrister Simon Mayo QC why she had insisted to officers she had not injected her mother, she said: "I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had
The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. "After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully
He threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid failed, and the Football Association turned it down in April. "When I say something, I mean it," the 75-year-old Egyptian said on Thursday. He added that the club had been put up for sale 22 hours after the FA's decision five months ago. Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. "We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked," he said. "As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale." Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. "I will give it away. Out means
Scot Higgins, 19, started his youth career at Celtic before moving to Dens Park and made four appearances for Dundee last season. Former Republish of Ireland Under-21 player Power, 29, leaves English League Two club Lincoln City, where he made over 250 league appearances. Both players have agreed two-year contracts with the Rugby Park club, with Power's move subject to clearance. "It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction," Higgins told Kilmarnock's website. Manager Lee McCulloch said Higgins fits Kilmarnock's philosophy of developing young players. "He came through Celtic's academy, which has seen many impressive young players come through," said McCulloch. "For the second half of last season he gained experience at Dundee and through time will only get better, which is only a good thing for this club." And Power said: "I've heard a lot about the town and the club's history and I can't wait to get started. The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make." McCulloch said he watch Lincoln's run to the
England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Itoje. Harrison, 24, lasted just half an hour in England's last Test match against Australia in Sydney. "He's gone back and worked on his game very hard," Jones told BBC Sport. "His last game against Castres was exceptional and he's probably our number one choice open-side flanker at the moment." Meanwhile Jones says the recalled flanker Tom Wood has a "great chance" of being selected this autumn. Wood was dropped following the Rugby World Cup, with Jones telling him his performances were "distinctly average". "He's improved his work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier, and he's certainly above average now," Jones added. "He's got very good lineout skills and his breakdown work has improved. So we are excited about him being in the squad. "His [lineout work] gives him a great chance of being selected." Jones has selected six uncapped players in his 33-man squad, but has played down their chances of being selected against the Springboks on 12 November.
Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a hoax. The @RogueNASA account says it is the "unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA". "Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark," the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure "factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Media reports have suggested that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue
A report from British Marine, which represents the leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine industry, said superyacht revenues for the year to April 2016 had reached £605m. Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to £3.01bn, the first time the £3bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of £2,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to £882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against
The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four "de-escalation zones" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition grouping says it has little faith in the deal. Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked "safeguards and compliance mechanisms". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Syrian fighter jets on Saturday bombed rebel positions in Hama. A rebel commander confirmed that fighting had broken out after midnight, Reuters reports. The Syrian military have so far not commented on the issue. The so-called "memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the
The country's Chamber of Deputies had already approved the legislation. The vote in the Senate, which backed the bill by just six votes, came after 14 hours of at times heated debate. The law, which also allows same-sex couples to adopt, had met with fierce opposition from the Catholic Church and other religious groups. The legislation, backed by President Cristina Fernandez's centre-left government, passed by 33 votes to 27 with three abstentions. Outside Congress, as the debate continued into the early hours of Thursday, supporters and opponents of the bill held rival demonstrations. "Nearly every political and social figure has spoken out in favour of marriage equality," said Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals. "And we hope that the Senate reflects this and that Argentina, from today forward, is a more just country for all families," she told the Associated Press. Your commentsQ&A: Argentina gay marriage law Ines Frank, from a group called Argentine Families Argentina, said opposition was not discrimination "because the essence of a family is between two people of
The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The
The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were "not good enough", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of Â£2.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it "can and should do more". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in "urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations
The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with the internet news group the Daily Beast two years ago. The Daily Beast's founder, Tina Brown, said its site now had more than 15 million unique visitors a month, a 70% increase on last year. She said in a statement: "Exiting print is an extremely difficult moment for all of us who love the romance of print and the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night. By Ben ThompsonBusiness reporter, New York In 1933, Newsweek hit the news stands - a weekly magazine covering global events. But much like the world it's reported on over the last 80 years, much has changed in the publishing world too. Not least how consumers get their news. The number of Newsweek subscribers has slumped from more than 3 million at its peak to 1.5 million today. Couple that with falling advertising revenues for traditional print media and it's led Newsweek to ditch its print edition altogether. Newsweek Global, the digital only version, will be available via a subscription.
Spencer Flower claimed his involvement with a social housing company was not relevant to a debate in 2013 over the future of housing in east Dorset. But he was found guilty of voting illegally as the firm could have benefitted from the plan being passed. The Conservative councillor, 72, will be allowed to remain in public office. Flower, of Verwood, Dorset, was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay Â£930 costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court ruled he had broken laws under the Localism Act 2011. Speaking outside court, Flower refused to comment on his political future. He said: "I am surprised and disappointed that the court has found for the prosecution this morning on a technicality. "The decision was a conditional discharge for six months - the lowest possible penalty. "The court emphasised the total lack of any personal gain or intent on my part." Flower, who is also an East Dorset councillor, voted in February 2013 on East Dorset's core strategy while non-executive director of charitable social housing company Synergy Housing Ltd, for which he received an annual allowance of about Â£5,000. The vote concerned whether the strategy for the area should
The Starman's swansong, Blackstar, spent a third week at number one, with Best of Bowie, Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust all in the Top 10. Adele remained at two, while Suede, who were heavily inspired by Bowie, scored the highest new entry at number six. Rihanna's new album, Anti, did not chart after its release on Thursday. The record was considered ineligible as it was initially given away via the streaming music site Tidal. Official chart company rules state that free downloads do not count towards the top 40. However, the Bajan star did score a new entry in the singles chart. Work, her duet with Drake, made its first appearance at 13 after just 48 hours on sale. The highest new entry, at three, is a dance version of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car by London-based producer Jonas Blue. His tropical-flavoured remake, which features vocals by singer Dakota, beat the original song's performance, which charted at number five in 1988; and reached number four in 2011 following a rendition
Mr Joshua told his congregation on Sunday that he "saw" a woman winning. After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the preacher's Facebook page noticed the prophecy had been removed. The wealthy pastor is known as "the prophet" to his many followers. He is one of Nigeria's best-known and influential evangelists - and is popular across Africa, with many top politicians among his flock. The US election prediction was broadcast on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV, which an individual uploaded to YouTube. A section of that "prophecy" was posted on the preacher's Facebook page but is no longer available. "Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman," it said. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa as people shared memes poking fun at his prediction. People have also taken to a Facebook entry he posted on Wednesday to complain. Clive Mashiri from South Africa asked: "Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?" Though
Entrants to the annual event have five minutes to tell the biggest and most convincing lie they can. Winner George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria was surprised to win as he was "struggling" with a chest infection. In his story he "ended up bumping into Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel", he said. "It was a tale about building a small submarine out of my dad's old bubble car," he said. "We took the bubble car on a trip to the Isle of Man and we bumped into several famous people in a Scottish submarine made out of shortbread tins. "Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond sold some of these giant shortbread tin submarines to the United States of America." Last year's winner Mike Naylor, known as Monkey Liar, from Wasdale came second. Helen Jordan came third. Previous winners include comedian and television presenter Sue Perkins in 2006. In 2014 one entrant had travelled from Germany to take part.
Mark Footitt took 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch while Sam Curran dismissed England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three
Sales at the company rose to â‚¬34.2bn (Â£28.8bn) in the year to August. The chain opened 12 new stores, which helped total sales to rise 7.1%, but that increase was lower than the 11% growth seen in the previous 12 months. Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 5% - the same as last year. The privately-owned Swedish group said sales in Poland jumped about 20%, making the country its fastest-growing market, while Australia and Canada also performed well. Germany was still the retailer's largest market, closely followed by the United States. Ikea will open its first stores in India and Serbia this year and now has 340 outlets in 28 countries. However, expansion into Russia has been put on hold as Ikea seeks to solve "a number of old legal disputes". The chain has 19 stores in the UK, with new outlets planned for Exeter, Sheffield and southeast London. As well as opening 12 new stores in the year, Ikea opened
Mr Reagan and three others were injured in the shooting outside a hotel in Washington in March 1981. Mr Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was sent for treatment to a Washington hospital. In July, a judge ruled that Mr Hinckley, now 61, was not a danger to himself or the public. Mr Hinckley had already been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia under strict conditions. Associated Press reported that he had arrived at her home having been freed on Saturday. Marking 30 years since Reagan's shooting Life after shooting a US president As part of his release he will: The shooting, just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, shocked the world. Mr Reagan was shot in the lung, but recovered. His press secretary James Brady was shot in the head, suffered brain damage and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Mr Brady's death in 2014 at the age of 73 was ruled to be a homicide, but no further charges against Hinckley were brought. Two law enforcement officers
The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000 to more than 230 creditors. One director said it was due to escalating costs and being owed money. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis called it a "disaster" for people in the area who were owed money. Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of £107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors were "totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt". The report indicated almost £470,000 was owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr Sollis, who is owed almost £15,000 by Emcol, said: "It was a disaster in a sense the amount of money that people have lost in the locality and not now having a local abattoir to move stock to or casualties. "Casualties and stock
Ben Purdy, 18, was shot in the head in Bermondsey after confronting his girlfriend's ex about "threatening" messages sent after their break-up. Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, of Hospital Way - both in Lewisham - were found guilty of the murder. They will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 20 November. The court heard Mr Purdy and two of his friends - Callum Malone and Jack Walker - confronted Bagnell, and, following the "skirmish" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey looking for Mr Purdy. When they found him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head then pointed the gun towards Callum before making off. Mr Purdy suffered "catastrophic injuries" and died the next day, the court heard. Despite the fact Bagnall had a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors, it still "rankled" that she had moved on and he sent her "threatening messages" by phone and on Facebook. Mr Aylett said: "Ben obviously had enough and so that Sunday, around lunchtime, with two friends to help - Callum
Masai Graham won with the gag: "My dad suggested I register for a donor card, he's a man after my own heart." The festival's best jokes were selected by a panel of 10 judges before being put to 2,000 people, who voted for their favourite. Tim Vine, Stewart Francis and Zoe Lyon have previously won the competition, run by TV channel Dave. Graham, from West Bromwich, claimed the victory after making the shortlist in both 2014 and 2015. He said "It's an incredible honour to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!" Comedian Stuart Mitchell came second in the poll, with the joke: "Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one..." Judges sat through an average of 60 different comedy performances and sifted through more than 3,600 minutes of material before selecting their favourite gags. In a bid to judge only the quality of the joke,
The Halle Orchestra wants to open a school in Stoke-on-Trent in 2020, for both primary and secondary pupils. The orchestra will work with an academy trust in setting up the school. John Summers, chief executive of the orchestra, said the project would use music to "raise aspirations" across other academic subjects. The school, proposed with the City Learning Trust, would be part of the free schools programme - and approval for its opening depends on the Department for Education. But the orchestra wants to open the school in September 2020, for seven to 19-year-olds, with the promise of masterclasses from musicians, access to concerts and artists in residence. The intention is for students to spend 40% of their time in specialist music classes, working with the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra and Halle for Youth. "The Halle has a huge amount of expertise and experience in working at high level performance, both in terms of instrumental coaching and choral training," said John Summers, chief executive of the Halle. "Through our expertise we will also help develop music in the curriculum as
Heading the processions were some of those caught up in the suicide bomb attacks on Belgium's airport and metro station that killed 32 people. Belgian broadcaster described the march as "calm and silent". The march had been due to be held a week after the 22 March attacks, but officials asked for it to be postponed because of the security threat. Relatives of victims, and paramedics and airport staff affected by the attacks joined people of several religious faiths on Sunday's march. Flowers were carried in memory of those who lost their lives. The procession took them past the Molenbeek neighbourhood - where many of those alleged to have carried out the attacks in both Brussels and Paris had lived - and to the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. One of the organisers of the march, Hassan Bousetta, told the AFP news agency: "When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity." The turnout was less than half of the 15,000 organisers had hoped for. The attacks in Brussels were claimed by
The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two discoveries in the area last year, estimated fields there could contain more than a billion barrels of oil. Its evaluation plan will start shortly with a 3D seismic survey. Later this year it aims to launch a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme. Edinburgh-based Cairn has a 40% interest in three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips (35%) and FAR Ltd (15%), with Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retaining a 10% interest in the exploration phase. In its latest half-yearly report, Cairn also said that it had started international arbitration proceedings with the government of India over a tax row. Cairn has been prevented by Indian authorities from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company received a tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties, covering the tax
Tear gas and live bullets were fired to drive back the mainly Shia Muslim crowds, as they protested against corruption and security failures. Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' "peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US
Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of lying to mortgage lenders to amass nearly Â£1m of property in a bid to "control and dominate" areas of the city. Akhtar was jailed for 14 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Read more updates on this story and more from across Stoke and Staffordshire Following a trial last month, the 60-year-old, of Farman Close in Fenton, was convicted of 11 charges including five of conspiracy to commit fraud and cheating Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) out of Â£271,000. The court heard how Akhtar, who was also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton and helped raise several million pounds in donations to fight poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre, the court heard. But judge Stephen Eyre said he had "let down his followers". He said: "[You used] the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. "Your role as a spiritual guide
Media playback is not supported on this device Jones won gold four years ago and will defend her title in the -57kg weight category at Rio 2016. The 23-year-old says she was inspired to achieve success as a youngster growing up in north Wales. "I remember watching people like Kelly Holmes on the TV and that's what inspired me to want to go and get a gold medal," she said. "To think I'm one of those role models now and people are looking up to me is lovely. "I've seen the difference from London how many girls have got into taekwondo because they've watched it on the TV." Jones took up taekwondo when she was 15-years-old, encouraged by grandfather Martin as it would "keep her off the streets." "When I first started taekwondo I think there was only about four or five girls in the whole club," Jones added. "Now there's loads more girls and it's just amazing
Remus Hamza, 40, is alleged to have attacked the 20-year-old near Cardiff University as she walked home alone after a night out with friends on 20 September. The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was "so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. "The actions in these circumstances amount to rape," Ms Pickthall said. "He was preying on single, drunk females." The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza
Helen Bailey, 51, was found dead in a cess pit at her house in Royston, Hertfordshire, in July 2016. She had not been seen since 11 April. Ian Stewart, her fiance, denies murder. Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, "driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was "about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13
The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: "We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims". The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce "hateful rhetoric" was "disturbing and wrong". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: "I like this guy." "We have a problem in this country called Muslims," the man said. "We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American." "We need this question?" Mr Trump said, laughing. "But anyway," the man continued, "we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that "bad things are happening" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: "Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out." In a statement,
He's also having to get used to the media and laying out his policies - many of which are quite distinct from the previous leader's. Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: "These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. "There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees." His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today. He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country.
The bodies of backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014. Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. "We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014," said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found
That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) said. The divide between the most peaceful and the least peaceful nations was deepening, the annual report added. Iceland is the world's most peaceful nation, whilst Syria is the least. Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking for 2013. Conflict killed 180,000 people in 2014, compared with 49,000 in 2010, the report said. Deaths caused by terrorism increased by 61% in 2013, the report said, with the loss of almost 18,000 lives - mostly in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Figures compared If the world decreased in violence by 10%, it would generate Â£1.43tn, says the IEP. This amount is equivalent to: Source:
Falcon and Pointer was fined £175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined £50,000 for asking to speak to people's dead relatives. Both companies claimed the calls were made by a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, said it sent a "clear message to callous cold-callers". She said: "It increasingly appears from our investigations that Swansea is the UK's cold-call capital. "Companies in the city have been trying to cash in using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make calls which are at best irksome and at worst distressing." The commissioner (ICO) has taken action against six companies since 2013. Falcon and Pointer had its licence revoked in January 2016 and told the ICO it had stopped making the calls in June 2015 - but an investigation found it made a further two million calls in the following two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, which sells windows, doors and conservatories, received 168 complaints in six months. Ms Jones
The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite using "reasonable force" against the unidentified patient, said the Prison Officers' Association (POA). But Mersey Care Trust, which runs Ashworth, said the evidence meant sacking the pair was its only option. More on this story and other news from Merseyside and Cheshire The dispute at the unit, one of three high security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, said: "I believe the general public will be outraged and extremely sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson, who were merely responding to a violent act in which the patient had headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff during the incident. "The actions of restraint were reasonable and the patient came to no harm, unlike the nurses. Whilst there should always be a duty of care towards patients the same must apply to staff." The trust said it was "disappointed" by the union's decision to strike before the case is heard at an independent employment tribunal. "We do not believe this
Charles Blackman's oil work Women Lovers features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for "advertising adult products or services". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was "ridiculous". "This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form," he told the BBC. "It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing." Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. "Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements," Facebook said in a message. Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after it suspended his account for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th Century artist Gustave Courbet. Mr Summer said Women Lovers
The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set at the height of the Cold War, is being adapted by the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire, Simon Beaufoy. It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was "very excited" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965 and le Carre said
OUP analysed more than 120,421 short stories by children aged between five and 13 years old, submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition. According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences. The use of the hashtag symbol # to add an extra meaning or comment at the end of a sentence has become commonplace. #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press said: "This has been a significant change in usage in this year, 2015. "Children have extended its [#] use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment." Other words on the technological endangered list are iPod, mp3 and Blackberry. In their place are iPhone, chat app WhatsApp and messaging site ooVoo.
The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player "some time ago". "To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue," he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. "I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands," added Slade. "There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say." Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of
The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was "quite an innovative step". He
The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a "growing threat", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific "Ring of fire", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. "The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume," said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. "From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the
The girl, who has Smith-Magenis Syndrome, was arrested four times and twice held overnight in police stations. Her mother complained about her treatment to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Sussex Police said it welcomed the IPCC scrutiny and supported its inquiry. The girl came into contact with police between 2 February and 2 March last year in Horsham, West Sussex. She was held under under the mental health act on 9 February, arrested on suspicion of assault seven days later, held over a public order offence on 29 February and arrested in connection with criminal damage on 2 March. The girl's mother complained in July 2012 about the methods of restraint used on her daughter, which the IPCC said appeared to have included handcuffs and leg restraints, and the decisions to hold her in police cells overnight. Commissioner Mike Franklin said: "The IPCC investigation is examining the nature and circumstances of the officers' interaction with the girl to determine whether the degree of force and method of restraint used by officers was appropriate and in accordance with the law, the officers' training and force
PC Frances Tilley admitted she had "destroyed her career" after evading payment for a journey between Bristol Temple Meads station and Castle Cary in Somerset last June. A disciplinary hearing at Northamptonshire Police headquarters heard she was less than two years into her job and was still on probation. She was dismissed for gross misconduct. The hearing at Wootton Hall heard Tilley travelled from Northampton to Castle Cary on 22 June last year. The officer, described as "diligent, professional and committed", was travelling with friends and did not buy a ticket for the final leg of her journey. Force solicitor Elizabeth Briggs said: "She travelled from Bristol to Westbury and onto Castle Cary. At that stage, she did not have a valid ticket to travel. "There were opportunities for her to purchase a ticket. "She said it was her intention to not pay a rail fare for that part of the journey." A single off-peak ticket from Bristol Temple Meads to Castle Cary would cost
Rachel Miller has paid "brokers" up to Â£7,500 a time to free sex slaves. She travelled to parts of southern Turkey this summer that the Foreign Office had declared no-go zones. But the recent coup attempt in Turkey means she cannot work "under the radar" any longer, she said. Ms Miller, 40, a mother-of-three from Cinderhill in Nottingham, said her Kurdish husband supported her work but she did not always tell him the full story until after she had returned. "I don't deal directly with the slavers - but I deal with a broker who has contacted a family that wants to free their child from slavery," she said. "He says I can get your daughter but it will cost - it can cost up to $10,000." Her husband often stays in Britain with their two young children, who are seven and eight years old, while she makes her trips abroad. She said she would not be returning to Turkey in the near future as "the police presence and road blocks have increased". "I could feel the tension and I was worried I might be arrested," she explained. She has raised almost Â£40,000 in crowd funding to
But he fancied his video game skills and entered Nissan's GT Academy competition while on a gap year. After beating 90,000 other gamers at racing simulation game Gran Turismo, Jann was offered the chance to train as a professional driver. He's now joining Arden Motorsport to compete in the 2014 GP3 series, which is just two rungs below Formula 1. The 22-year-old from Cardiff has also been taken on by Infiniti Red Bull's driver development programme. Jann says winning GT Academy was a huge shock: "I thought I was pretty good because I could beat my friends on my street, but it was the first time trial I ever entered. "I just wanted to see how I stacked up against people across Europe but I didn't expect to win. No way I thought that!" Since 2011 he has competed in British GT, Formula 3's European Championship, and a series in New Zealand, but describes the latest step up as "big boy time". GP3 launched in 2010 and follows the entire European leg of the Formula 1 season. That means Jann
Officers at first did not treat Stephen Phillips's death as suspicious after he was found in his Wolverhampton flat. His family became suspicious when they found two mobile phones were missing. Tests proved he had been struck before he fell. Lewis Thornton, 24, has been jailed for 10 years for Mr Phillips' manslaughter and robbery. Mr Phillips, aged, 54 and a father of six, died from a head injury on 11 March 2015 at his home in Dudley Road, Blakenhall. More on this story and others Birmingham and Black Country He had been punched in the head in a nearby street, causing him to fracture his skull as he fell. He managed to walk back to his flat but died from his head injury and internal bleeding. The court heard his death was at first treated by police as non-suspicious, as it was thought he had fallen at home after drinking. But his family went back to the police when they realised his phones were missing. "We rang the police but we were told we would have to wait for the post-mortem," his partner, Tina Fury, said. "So we
Mrs Foster said on Wednesday that she wanted to better understand those who love the language. She said she wanted to "listen to and engage with those from the Gaelic Irish background, those without the party political background". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped the meeting would happen soon. "It's a positive move," he said. "Anything that encourages dialogue, that encourages conversations, that encourages increased understanding has to be positive." Stormont's parties have "paused" talks to strike a deal to form an executive until after Easter. The parties have yet to find a deal almost six weeks after the assembly election. One of Sinn Féin's key priorities in the talks is a guarantee that an Irish Language Act will be enacted. In February, Arlene Foster said the DUP would never agree to an Irish Language Act. But she has now said she would meet with "people who genuinely love the Irish language and don't want to use it as a political weapon". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped she would listen carefully to the views of Irish speakers as they are "united and firm on the need for an Irish Language
Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him "significant discomfort" for months. Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as "unbelievable". "It's very unfortunate," said the Frenchman. "It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again." Debuchy has played just 14 times since signing from Newcastle in July in a deal worth a reported £12m. With Kieran Gibbs recovering from an inflamed heel, 19-year-old Hector Bellerin or Calum Chambers may deputise against Manchester City on Sunday. Arsenal took the decision to send Arteta for surgery to preserve his long-term fitness. The Spaniard last played on 26 November in a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund. "He had limited mobility in his ankle and some persistent inflammation that had an impact on his calf," explained Wenger. "That meant we had to make the decision
The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used to beam images and videos onto walls. The Smart Cast phone was unveiled at the company's Tech World conference in Beijing, where the firm also unveiled a new type of smartwatch. The laser projector measures just 34mm by 26mm by 5mm and, said Lenovo, does not need focussing to project sharp images onto walls or other flat surfaces. A video showing the Smart Cast in action shows how twisting the mounting for the device's lens turns it from a standard wall projector into "surface mode" that beams the display on to a table top. A kickstand mounted on the back of the phone keeps the device upright while the virtual keyboard is in use. At Tech World, Chinese concert pianist Lang Lang used the virtual keyboard to play a version of The Entertainer. Mike Lowe, reviews editor at gadget site Pocket-lint, who has
Sterling rose 1.86% against the dollar to $1.32.40, and was 1.73% higher against the euro at â‚¬1.19.57. The FTSE 100 share index hit fresh 11-month highs before falling back and closing scarcely changed at 6,680.69, that is a slight fall of 2.17 points or 0.03%. The more UK-focused FTSE 250 index rose 68.75 points, or 0.4%, to 16,775.14. The property sector - which saw a steep sell-off immediately after the Brexit vote - received a boost from Galliford Try. The housebuilder said it still expected full-year profits to be in line with expectations sending its shares up 8.5%. Financial stocks - another victim of the post-referendum sell-off - were also having a better day. Shares in insurer Aviva rose 4.26% while Lloyds Banking Group gained 2.55%. "Theresa May's virtual 'coronation' as prime minister has delivered a boost to the pound as the clouds of uncertainty following the Brexit vote start to disperse," said Neil Wilson, markets analyst at
The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of "buildings as power stations". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel "skins" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a "game changer" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid. They were close to reaching a target too when the technology could be incorporated into the design of
Erika Murray, 31, was arrested on Thursday night after a neighbour alerted police over the safety of other children living at the house. Detectives found the bodies in what they described as a squalid, vermin-infested home. On Friday Ms Murray pleaded not guilty to all charges. Those include foetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child. Her lawyer said he believed she suffered with mental illness. "You want answers in circumstances like this... mental illness doesn't always provide those kinds of answers," Ms Murray's lawyer Keith Halpern said after her court appearance. Police were first called to the home in Blackstone when a neighbour was approached by one of the children living there, said Tim Connolly, a spokesman for the Worcester district attorney. The ten-year boy is reported to have asked the neighbour, "How do you get a baby to stop crying?" The neighbour went with the boy and found the crying
The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after witnessing her mother's treatment, was made a CBE. Helene Donnelly, a nurse who became a whistleblower, was made an OBE. Figures suggested there were more deaths than would have been expected at Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2008. Patients needing pain relief either got it late or not at all, leaving them crying out for help, and there were cases where food and drinks were left out of reach. Helene Donnelly worked in the A&E department at the hospital. She raised nearly 100 complaints about the treatment of patients, turned whistleblower and was a key witness at the Stafford Hospital public inquiry. She told the BBC she was "tremendously proud and honoured" to receive the OBE for services to the NHS, after what had been a "very difficult time personally and professionally". Ms Donnelly said she was surprised when she found out: "It was rather surreal really, I was completely shocked, I thought is this some sort
Yorkshire batsman Joe Root has been named as new Test captain after Alastair Cook resigned after more than four years in charge. "We need to win but we want to perform in a manner that makes people want to come and watch us," Stokes said. Root's first Test match as England skipper is against South Africa at Lord's beginning on 7 July. The 26-year-old has stepped up from vice-captain, with Durham all-rounder Stokes, 25, filling the role as his deputy. "Test cricket is the pinnacle and we need people to fall in love with it again," added Stokes. Discussing his elevation to vice-captain, he added: "Everything I do is to win and being vice-captain won't change me as a person or as a player. Media playback is not supported on this device "I want to be involved in all aspects of the game, whether it's hitting the winning runs or taking the final wicket.
Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US. Hanjin's main creditors said it would be difficult to accept a request
Buckingham Palace announced on Friday evening that the Queen would not attend because she had gastroenteritis. Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan Byron Lewis took over the ceremonial role. The battalion's commanding officer said it would have been a first to have been presented leeks by the Queen. The cancellation by the Queen led to more sparse crowds watching the ceremony than had been anticipated. Speaking beforehand, commanding officer Rob Manuel said it had been "a bit of a surprise" when the announcement that the Queen would not be attending was made. However, he told BBC News: "We switched to plan B, and our thoughts and wishes are with her and we hope that she makes a speedy recovery. "The lord lieutenant has stepped into the breach. Today is going to run as per normal. "It would have certainly been a first for the queen to present leeks to 3rd Battalion, being a reserve battalion, especially for the chaps who have just come back from Afghanistan just before Christmas.
The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year. A probation report three months earlier warned he might snatch a child "at any time", Leicester Crown Court heard. Jetha, 32, was told he must serve at least 11 years. Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire He previously admitted some offences relating to last year's attack but on Monday changed his plea to guilty to all 10 charges relating to the boy, known only as Child A, which included photographing his assault. He also admitted a further 10 unconnected child sex offences. During the sentencing hearing on Tuesday, it was revealed just three months before the brutal assault in Leicester a Probation Service report said "he could at any time take a child off the street". Speaking after the hearing, Lawrence English, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "The police were obviously aware of that [report] and were keeping as close an eye on Jetha as they possibly could. "Obviously it's
They began their trip by travelling to the Seamus Heaney Homeplace Centre in Bellaghy, where they met members of the poet's family. The Royal couple will attend a series of engagements in Londonderry, Belfast and County Down during their visit. During their visit to Bellaghy, the Royal couple toured the visitors' centre. The village inspired many of Seamus Heaney's most memorable lines. Prince Charles has had a long interest in the Nobel prize-winning poet's work and met him on a number of occasions. After leaving Bellaghy, they met staff and patients at the North West Cancer Centre at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry. On Tuesday evening they attended a musical gathering at Hillsborough Castle, in County Down. They are also expected to officially open a memorial garden to members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) who were killed while on duty. On Wednesday, the couple will begin an official visit in the Republic of Ireland, at the request of the British government. Their engagements are expected to include meetings with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny, Irish President Michael D Higgins and a visit to Kilkenny Castle. They
The H3 project combines back office services at four police, fire and council authorities in Hampshire and Oxfordshire, to save up to £5m a year. The Police Federation said payroll mistakes were among a "catalogue of errors" since H3 began in 2014. Hampshire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) said the investment would deliver improvements by May. A report to PCC Michael Lane said H3 had caused problems with recruitment and the management of staff sickness, as well as "weighing down" police officers with "back office processes which restrict their effectiveness". In February 2016, 1,300 officers received the wrong pay, while some allowances were wrongly calculated in March. In 2015, the BBC learned that payment delays to Hampshire County Council's suppliers had trebled. under the new system. Hampshire Police Federation chairman John Apter said the system had been "poorly conceived, implemented and delivered". "On paper it looked great but in reality it was shambolic and... the fall-out... has been nothing short of a disgrace," he said. Mr Lane
The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a "nail in the coffin" for recruiting overseas students. The Home Office has argued there are no limits on numbers of genuine students. Universities have already been lobbying ministers to remove overseas students from migration targets - but the new English language proposals, if they were given the go-ahead, would mean even an higher threshold for entry. Universities argue that overseas students are increasingly important to the UK economy and that raising more barriers sends out a negative message in this competitive global market. Universities UK says overseas students are worth Â£7bn to the UK each year. Mr Scott, head of the advisory body on international students, described the revised language requirements as "pretty extreme". He warned that if implemented they would have a "massively damaging effect" on universities wanting to recruit overseas students, preventing about 15% of the current intake from gaining visas. Mr Scott said universities of all kinds saw the proposals as a "major concern" and would be asking
The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be encouraged to pay off more of their debt when they could. The FCA inquiry has analysed the five-year history of 34 million cardholders. The City watchdog also interviewed 40,000 people about their credit card use. Its interim findings include: The watchdog said while there was strong competition for some customers and products, other customers were not being targeted. Providers were quick to intervene when customers missed payments as they were "extremely unprofitable", but the same was not true of those just getting by. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said: "The FCA is absolutely right to be concerned about the 1.6 million people who are just about surviving by making minimum payments, often on multiple credit cards. "As the report highlights, credit card companies usually intervene effectively to help customers who begin to miss payments, and many work closely with debt
Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would seek a third term. At least 439 people have died and 240,000 have fled abroad, the UN says. African Union (AU) leaders are due to discuss the crisis in Burundi at a summit in Ethiopia. They want Mr Nkurunziza to accept peacekeeping troops to prevent Burundi sliding into ethnic conflict, but analysts say he is unlikely to agree. Burundi on the brink Tit-for-tat killings spread fear Burundi's football-playing president Presidents who cling to power Amnesty says satellite images show disturbed earth at sites in the Buringa area on the edge of the capital Bujumbura that are consistent with witness reports. "These images suggest a deliberate effort by the authorities to cover up the extent of the killings by their security forces and to prevent the full truth from coming out," said Muthoni Wanyeki, Amnesty's regional director for East
Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it "difficult to control his violence when he felt humiliated" and "historically would become angry and punch people". The 36-year-old denies murdering six-year-old Ellie at their home in Sutton, south west London, in October 2013. Dr Green interviewed Mr Butler over four hours after he pleaded guilty to assaulting a man in Kingston upon Thames 12 years ago, the Old Bailey heard. Prosecutor Ed Brown QC read sections of the report in which Dr Green noted Mr Butler was "co-operative" and answered questions "frankly". Dr Green wrote: "He stated that he had in the past hoped that situations might present themselves where he could engage in violence. "He believed that violence could help him improve his mood when he was upset. Historically he would become angry and punch people. "He was adamant he had never hit anybody without a reason. He also said at times he would find it difficult to control his violence when he felt humiliated or was made fun of." Ellie died at the family home 11
The furry feline has been a familiar face on the steps outside Number 10's black door since he moved in, in 2011. And the "chief mouser" will stay when Theresa May replaces Mr Cameron as UK prime minister. "It's a civil servant's cat and does not belong to the Camerons - he will be staying," a government spokesman said. The tabby cat, from London's Battersea Cats and Dogs Home, was brought in to Downing Street in 2011 tasked with tackling a rat problem, after a large black rat was seen scuttling past the No 10's front door in the background of a live TV broadcast. Said to have a "strong predatory drive" and enjoy playing with mouse toys, Larry was considered to be well-suited to the post. Downing Street cats: A history Larry followed in the paw prints of several Downing Street moggies, known unofficially as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He was the first cat to hold the appointment since Humphrey - who was adopted in 1989 after wandering in to No 10 as a stray during Margaret Thatcher's premiership - was retired in 1997. Mr Cameron said he
The fragile piece of wood is all that remains of the Nanteos Cup, a wooden chalice named after the mansion in Aberystwyth where it was once kept. Some believe it was the cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper and that it has healing powers. It was stolen in 2014 before being returned to its owners a year later. It has now been donated to the library in Aberystwyth where thousands of people are expected to view it over the coming months. Pedr ap Llwyd, director of collections and public programmes, said visitors would finally be able to view the "mysterious object". "This is truly a remarkable object and a very interesting addition to the national collections." The cup is claimed to have been brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea after the death of Christ and then taken to Nanteos Mansion by seven monks from Strata Florida, Ceredigion, during the reign of Henry Vlll. The house was then owned by the Powell family and, after the monks died, they took possession of it for centuries. Legend
Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But prison authorities say an outsider will not be allowed into the prison to prepare his meals. The king was arrested last month after a security force raid on his palace in western Uganda's Kasese district. More than 80 people were killed in the clashes. The 64-year-old monarch denies any involvement in violence. He was arrested with more than 150 people, including royal guards. His lawyer, Caleb Alaka, told the BBC he will ensure that prison officials comply with the court order. Mr Alaka said he initially thought there was a royal cook among those arrested but they had all "perished" during the raid on the palace. The monarch would accept a cook appointed by prison authorities, he added. Officials also said there were no plugs in the cells to power fridges, local media reports. But Mr Alaka told
These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted by Joop Van Der Linde, a guest at Ndutu Safari Lodge in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The scene is the Serengeti; the attentive mother, five-year-old Nosikitok. The lioness has a GPS collar fitted by Kope Lion, a conservation NGO, and three young cubs of her own - born around the 27-28 June. Dr Luke Hunter, President and Chief Conservation Officer for Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organisation which supports Kope Lion, told the BBC the incident was "truly unique". "It's not something that I'm aware has ever happened before between large cats like this," he said. "We know there are cases where lionesses will adopt other lion cubs... But this is unprecedented. "I know of no other case - between any large cat, for that matter - where the species has adopted or nursed the cub of another species." Most lionesses would normally kill a baby leopard if they found one, seeing just
Evha Jannath, 11, was on a school trip on Tuesday when she fell from a circular boat on Splash Canyon at Drayton Manor. Alton Towers and Legoland Windsor are among those to have closed similar water-based white knuckle rides. Drayton Manor said it would remain closed on Friday for health and safety investigations. Latest on this and other stories from Staffordshire Merlin Entertainments, which runs Legoland and Alton Towers, said it had closed the following rides: A spokesperson said that on learning of Tuesday's fatal fall at Drayton Manor, Merlin Entertainments shut the rides "with immediate effect" on a "precautionary basis". It said it expected to re-open the rides on Friday. Some sites, including Lightwater Valley, in North Yorkshire, and West Midland Safari Park, have not closed rides in response to the death at Drayton Manor. A safari park spokesman said it had, however, introduced a policy whereby all children need to be accompanied by an adult on its water rides. Evha's family, who released a statement through the campaign office of Leicester politician Keith Vaz on Wednesday evening, called for Splash Canyon to remain out
The holders, who also won the trophy in 2013, bowed out in the group stage despite six wins in 14 games. Promotion in the County Championship, though, is still a possibility. "We wanted to be in a position going into the last five games where we had something to play for, and we have," Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton. "We'll be pushing hard to get ourselves in there with maybe two games to go, one game to go. "I'm just looking forward to seeing us get stuck in and who knows, it could still be a pretty special season." With two promotion places available again this summer, Northants are currently third, 15 points behind second-placed Worcestershire, but with a game in hand. However, two of their remaining five matches are against leaders Nottinghamshire, the first starting at Trent Bridge on 28 August. "I'm looking forward to the first game because that will be like a Test match kind of atmosphere and a
The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%. On Thursday figures showed China's factory output contracting for the first time in six months. Economic growth slowed to a five-year low of 7.3% last quarter. Many economists had expected China to stimulate economic growth through fiscal spending rather than lowering rates. To offset the effect of lower rates on savers the bank said it would give banks the flexibility to offer higher deposit rates, up to 1.2 times the benchmark level, rather than 1.1 times. Shares in mining companies jumped by 3-4% after the cut on the hope that better growth would help sales of raw materials to China. Shares in Rio Tinto surged 3.9% percent and BHP Billiton rose 2.9%. The Australian and New Zealand currencies also strengthened reflecting their dependence on trade with China. President Xi Jinping told chief executives at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit this month
The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called "bearer bonds". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy clients to potentially hide assets. "We are cooperating with the authorities in these investigations," the bank said. The fresh investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and from the US Securities and Exchange Commission comes after UBS paid $780m (Â£512m) in 2009 to settle a separate Justice Department tax-evasion probe. And it comes as authorities in a range of countries are considering examining HSBC's actions in helping more than 100,000 wealthy individuals avoid paying tax. UBS made the announcement as it revealed a better-than-expected 13% rise in fourth quarter net profit to 963m Swiss francs (Â£683.9m). However, it warned the increased value of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies, following the Swiss National Bank's decision to abandon the cap on the currency's value against the euro, would "put pressure" on its profitability. "The increased value of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies, especially the US dollar and the euro, and negative interest rates in the eurozone and Switzerland will put pressure on our profitability and, if they persist, on some of
The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The donations were allegedly given in exchange for political support of a controversial merger. Ms Choi has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Choi Gee-sung, a Samsung vice chairman, and Chang Choong-ki, a president at the group, were being interviewed on Monday by special prosecutors about the corruption allegations. It was reported the pair were being treated as witnesses, rather than being suspected of any wrongdoing. The claims circle around a merger between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries. The deal went through despite significant opposition from shareholders, who said it would hurt minority shareholders while benefiting the family of Samsung's group owner Lee Kun-hee. South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), which owns stakes in both companies, sealed the deal by voting in favour of it and the head of the NPS has since been arrested. But prosecutors also allege that Samsung gave â‚¬2.8m euros ($3.1m; Â£2.5m) to a company co-owned by
The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase without needing to visit a separate website. The company's chief business officer, Omid Kordestani, said he wanted to reduce "friction" for users so they buy more things online. Google faces significant competition from Amazon, where many people now begin their search to buy products. "There's going to be a buy button. It's going to be imminent," said Mr Kordestani on stage at the Code Conference in California on Wednesday. The change would make it easier for shoppers to buy products featured in its shopping ads that appear alongside search results. Mr Kordestani also noted that about nine out of 10 purchases are still made offline. He added that the number of location-based searches to help users find something close to them had doubled in the past year. Getting users to buy products as a result of searching is a key revenue earner for Google which currently charges retailers a premium to appear in a prominent position on the results page following a relevant search query. "With Google Buy set to only be available on mobile devices and the search giant recently changing its algorithm to favour
The Black Caps, having been set a world record 504 to win, resumed on 142-3 and their challenge quickly folded. Brendon McCullum hit a run-a-ball 80 but the Kiwis were all out for 295. Spinner Nathan Lyon took 3-63 in the second innings, while Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Marsh claimed two wickets apiece. Australia's first innings 556-4 declared set them up for the victory and opener David Warner was named man of the match for his scores of 163 and 116. "I thought the first morning really set the tone for us with Joe Burns and Davy Warner batting so well," Australia captain Steve Smith said. "I thought the top order set the test match up for us. The partnerships that we had in that top three were crucial to our success." The second Test begins in Perth on Friday and the series concludes with the inaugural day-night Test in Adelaide. New Zealand now face
An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid rent for it to date. The Welsh Government is seeking legal advice over recovering the outstanding debt, a letter says. The company says talks are ongoing. It is not known how much the rent is worth. Mr Dickinson previously told BBC Wales that his firm was losing millions of pounds because of a dispute over landing rights. The Iron Maiden front-man set up Cardiff Aviation in 2012 at RAF St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, leasing a hangar called Twin Peaks from the Welsh Government. Welsh Government small business subsidiary Finance Wales has invested Â£1.6m. A letter from Simon Jones, director of transport and ICT infrastructure, to the assembly's Public Accounts Committee chairman Nick Ramsay said that, "to date", Cardiff Aviation "has not paid any rent for their use of Twin Peaks". "The company has put forward a number of reasons for not doing so," Mr Jones said. "The Welsh Government disputes the basis for the non-payment, and we note that other companies operate from St Athan successfully without any issues. "The Welsh
The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected. Personal data "was not compromised" in the attack, and all accounts affected had been refunded, the bank said. Tesco Bank has said it was hit by "a systematic, sophisticated attack" at the weekend. "We've now refunded all customer accounts affected by fraud and lifted the suspension of online debit transactions so that customers can use their accounts as normal," said chief executive Benny Higgins. Current account customers had been blocked from making online payments using their debit card since Sunday, an action the bank said it had taken "to prevent criminal activity". "We'd again like to apologise for the worry and inconvenience this issue has caused," said Mr Higgins. Mr Higgins said the bank knew "exactly" the nature of the attack, but could not say more because it was part of a criminal investigation. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is leading the investigation into the case. Tesco Bank
The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The following month Hutsby raped her. The IPCC report revealed the attack could have been prevented had arrest forms been filled out immediately. Det Supt Rachel Walker said officers had attended misconduct meetings. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded that PC Sofi Essex has a case to answer for misconduct for not creating an "arrest package" - paperwork completed before arrest attempts can begin - when asked. "Although eventually completed, the delay resulted in no action being taken to locate and arrest Craig Hutsby prior to the rape being committed," it said. PC Joseph Lovelock has a case answer for misconduct for failing to properly complete a form for the victim, the IPCC concluded. "This meant she was not identified as being at high risk of harm and appropriate measures to manage that risk could not be made," it said. Action taken by Derbyshire Constabulary The investigation also highlighted unsatisfactory performance by two police call handlers, who did not properly
Thomas, 28, is a key member of the Team Sky side trying to guide Chris Froome to a second successive Tour title. Froome has already been sent for an X-ray after a crash during the fourth stage of the Tour de France. "On the cobbles it's sketchy anyway. If it does rain it could end somebody's race quite easily," said Thomas. "You train all year for this and for it to end like that would be devastating for whoever it was. "So hopefully it stays dry and everyone stays out of trouble." Froome touched wheels in the peloton and fell just five kilometres into the 163.5km fourth stage between Le Touquet-Paris-Place and Lille Metropole. The 29-year-old suffered a grazed left hip and wrist injury, before quickly getting back on his bike and rejoining the peloton, after receiving medical attention from the race doctor. He is in seventh place overall, two seconds behind race leader Vincenzo Nibali after stage four was won by Marcel Kittel. Wednesday's stage begins in the Belgian city of Ypres and ends 155.5km away in Arenberg-Porte du Hainaut. Thomas helped Froome to
Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: "If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love." Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall. The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details. TfL says the consultation seeks to "raise standards across the industry" following an "exponential" growth in the private hire industry and technology. Uber said it was a deliberate target and if the proposals went ahead they would raise prices and increase congestion in London. Gareth Mead, from Uber, said: "If you think that this is supposed to be a public consultation, well I think the public are not at the heart of the proposals that have been made
The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Downing and Romaine Sawyers. Burton came close when Stuart Beavon tricked his way into Walsall's box but fired into the side-netting. Wigan's win over Bury means Albion's lead at the top is cut to two points, with Walsall staying in fourth. Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby: Media playback is not supported on this device "There was nothing in it at all. It was never going to be an open, free-flowing classic I don't think. "Chances were few and far between but we got a clean sheet and another point on the board. "We played better on Monday night, in terms of knocking the ball about, without doubt. But we got back to what the teams been all about for the last season or two - being solid and not giving anything away." Walsall head coach Sean O'Driscoll told BBC WM 95.6: Media playback is not supported on this device "I think
A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on. There are now almost half a million votes to send the singer to the secretive communist nation. The contest, which ends at 0600 on 7 July, saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days. Many of the votes are thought to originate from imageboard website 4chan, which has built a reputation for triggering online viral campaigns. The voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label. Given the fact that almost all citizens of North Korea are denied internet access and there are restrictive controls over all media, it is unlikely that any of the votes have actually come from within the country. A spokesman for the North Korean Embassy in London told BBC News that any application for 16-year-old Bieber to tour would be dealt with by its mission to the United Nations, although the matter would be referred to Pyongyang. Justin Bieber has been target of a number of internet pranks in recent weeks. Last month, a post on 4chan urged
The 10 trees have been nominated by members of the public for the competition run by the Woodland Trust charity. A public vote will decide the winner, which will then compete against trees from across the Continent for the title of European Tree of the Year. The online voting ends on 9 October. The Woodland Trust said a panel of experts whittled down 200 public nominations based on the nominees' story, The winning tree will benefit from a care grant of Â£1,000 and any tree receiving over 1,000 votes will receive a grant of Â£500. Nominations include the "Sycamore Gap" tree near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland. It appeared alongside Kevin Costner in the 1991 film Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. Another finalist is a tree in Sheffield which is threatened with felling as part of the city's street improvement scheme. Local campaigner Paul Selby, who nominated the tree, said "Reaching the shortlist for Tree of the Year highlights the national importance and recognition of the Chelsea Road Elm Tree. Another nominee that was facing the axe is the Seven Dials Elm tree in Brighton. The
Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a "professional" way, some officers still displayed "negative and uninformed" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: "A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms." The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would "slip through the net". In response, the College of Policing is setting up a pilot scheme to help officers identify possible patterns of abusive behaviour. David Tucker, the college's lead for crime and criminal justice, said: "We know in some cases of coercive
The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber. Under its constitution, Japan is barred from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. But a reinterpretation of the law will now allow "collective self-defence" - using force to defend allies under attack. Police are lining the streets and telling protesters to move along in an attempt to minimise disruption in the capital's centre. Despite the wet weather conditions, tens of thousands of protesters poured out onto the streets demanding that their pacifist constitution be protected and calling for the prime minister to step down. The streets were lined with police vans but given how unprecedented it is for the Japanese to be so vocal, there was never any fear that things would get out of hand. These demonstrations have been taking place all summer, mainly led by students and young
Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, set off to climb the Fansipan mountain alone on 3 June. He called his girlfriend to say he had fallen, injuring himself. It is understood he later fell down the waterfall while trying to make it to safety. His body was found on 9 June. Tests showed he died at about 07:00 on 4 June, after falling 18m (60ft). More news from Norfolk Mr Webb, an experienced climber, had started his ascent of the 3,100m (10,300ft) high mountain at about 06:00 and planned to climb it in a day. He had gone to Vietnam with his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan, 24, of White Notley, Essex, and she was in contact with him by phone from the nearest town of Sapa. Mr Webb told her he had fallen into a ravine having been forced off the main trail by a landslide. He had cut his arm open on a rock, hurt his knee and lost his way, but was trying to make it back to safety. The pair were in contact all night and last spoke
The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982 but it was a flop and is famously thought of as one of the worst video games ever made. It's thought Atari could have dumped millions of unsold copies in a landfill site in September 1983. Presented by Gordon Sinclair from retro gaming event Play Blackpool. 1.

The ET movie was so successful that everybody expected the video game would be popular too. But the graphics were poor and the game was frustrating to play. Game reviewer Aqualung said: "It's impossible to follow without the manual." "The real reason so many people hate it is that they have no clue what to do." Atari was desperate to get the game out in
Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and businesses were shut when major flooding hit Stoke Newington, Blackheath and Islington. Sadiq Khan said people were "rightly furious it appears lessons are not being learnt". Thames Water has said a "full investigation" will take place "to reduce the risk of further disruption". Mr Khan said the "huge damage" caused was "a devastating thing to happen in the run-up to Christmas". "It is right that Thames Water have launched a full investigation, and residents and business must now get full compensation," he said. Director Bob Collington told the BBC the firm had spent "about Â£1bn a year upgrading our network" but "clearly the events of the last few weeks point to the fact that we need to do even more". Some business owners have accused the company of "incompetence" over the floods. Gonen Ozer, who owns two businesses in Stoke Newington, said the mains had been leaking for several days but the water firm had only "patched it up temporarily". "I can only describe Thames Water's attitude as reckless, irresponsible and totally unprofessional", he said. Emily Oliphant
The Crawick Multiverse, designed by renowned artist Charles Jencks, has been created with materials found on the site in Dumfries and Galloway. The Â£1m project on land near Sanquhar was funded by the Duke of Buccleuch. It will be launched on Sunday with a performance by a cast of 30 dancers and musicians. The Crawick Artland Trust, which manages the site, has said it hopes to attract international visitors and boost business in Sanquhar, Kelloholm and Kirkconnel. The opening performance, which coincides with the Summer solstice, is called Oceanallover and it has been specially developed by artistic director Alex Rigg. He said: "Through conversations with Charles Jencks and with the Duke of Buccleuch and the local community, it is clear to me that my job is to present something which is interesting to look at in itself but allows other people to see the potential of the site for future events." The performance is likely to raise questions, rather than answer them, he said. "It's likely to be quite abstract at times and certainly not a conventional piece of theatre," he
The European Challenge Tour event will be part of a big week in the season with both the US PGA Championship and Women's British Open also taking place. Tournament ambassador Hoey expects several European Tour winners to be in the Galgorm field. They are set to come up against several up and coming stars of the future. "The NI Open will attract an even stronger field than in previous years," says five-time European Tour winner Hoey. "Especially because it has such a good place on the schedule." Hoey's fellow Irish European Tour winners Peter Lawrie, Damien McGrane and Simon Thornton are all expected to compete while Walker Cup hero from 2015, Ardglass man Cormac Sharvin, is also likely to tee up. While Rory McIlroy and the other stars of world golf will be in action at the US PGA at Baltursol, there is no other event on in Europe during Northern Ireland Open week which could convince a number of well-known players to make the trip to the Ballymena venue. Hoey says that many of his peers have already indicated that they intend to play at Galgorm. "Players want to compete at Galgorm
Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the gems, estimated to be worth $50m (Â£32m; 37m euros). They escaped back through the same hole. Police later found a burned-out vehicle close to the airport. Police are looking for eight men, a prosecutors' spokeswoman said. Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: "What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum." Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery "one of the biggest" ever. She said that the diamonds were "rough stones" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich. Antwerp is the hub of the world diamond trade - about 150m euros' worth of stones move in and out of the city every day, the spokeswoman added. Brussels prosecutor's spokeswoman Anja Bijnens said the thieves were masked and well armed, and used two black vehicles
The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 "age restricted ... high quality assisted living" apartments for which it said there was "a very high need" for, along with 12 holiday lets. Its proposal document states the hotel has "many deficiencies" and "few historic features of particular architectural or historic merit" following development in the 1960s and
