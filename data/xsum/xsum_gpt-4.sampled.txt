Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the shocking accident that resulted in severe injuries to a pedestrian late last Tuesday. The incident occurred along a notorious stretch of the M4 highway, renowned for treacherous conditions during heavy rainfall. Police reports suggest that Scott, a decorated military officer, lost control of his vehicle due to excessive speed and poor visibility, striking a 52-year-old man who was immediately rushed to the hospital in critical condition.  The Major now faces potential charges of reckless driving and causing serious bodily harm. He was released on bail awaiting a court hearing. The accident has prompted local authorities to reconsider safety measures on the M4, including the possibility of lowering speed limits during inclement weather. This tragic accident serves as a stark reminder of the vital importance of road safety, particularly in adverse weather conditions.
The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the region. The regulation has stirred international controversy, with human rights advocates voicing their concerns over the potential infringement on individual religious freedoms.  The local government in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has argued that the ban seeks to counteract extremism and maintain social harmony. They insist it is not an attempt to suppress the Islamic faith, but rather a measure to prevent the spread of radical ideologies. The ban includes items such as the burqa, a full-body veil worn by some Muslim women, and "jilbabs," outer garments covering the body. Critics, however, argue that the ban is a symptom of the broader issue of religious discrimination, particularly against the Uyghur Muslim minority. They warn against the potential for increased social alienation and unrest as a result of such measures
Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. "It was a regrettable error on my part," the veteran trainer admitted, and expects to face financial repercussions after falling foul of BHA's regulations on Champions Day. The infraction occurred when Palmer, renowned in the horseracing world for his numerous victories, ran an ineligible horse in one of the day's most prestigious races. Despite Palmer's pleas for leniency, citing a simple misunderstanding of the rules, the BHA is committed to maintaining the integrity of the sport. A spokesperson from the BHA affirmed, "While we appreciate Mr. Palmer's honesty in this matter, a breach in rules cannot be overlooked. Ensuring fair competition for all participants is our utmost priority." Whilst the exact amount of the fine is yet to be determined, some speculate it could potentially reach into the thousands, significantly affecting Palmer's earnings from Champions Day. Despite the setback, Palmer remains optimistic about his future in the sport, promising to ensure compliance with all BHA regulations going forward.
Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. The veteran teacher, who is highly respected among colleagues, stands accused of misconduct during a vocational training session. She allegedly smacked the teenager on the back of his head when he refused to remove his headphones and pay attention to the ongoing lesson. Hungerford, however, fervently contests the accusation, insisting that she only "tapped" the student in a bid to grab his attention. According to her testimony, she used no force and certainly no intent to harm the student.  The police were informed about the incident following a report from the college. After a thorough investigation, they concluded that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a criminal prosecution. The case has now moved to the hands of the Education Workforce Council, which will ultimately decide the fate of Hungerford's teaching career.  The incident has sparked a lively local debate on teacher

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had "fragile" staffing levels and needed to "implement more robust human resource strategies." Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has issued a stark warning about frailty in police staffing levels, stating that the force currently operates with "fragile" staffing levels and needs to "implement more robust human resource strategies." This recent assessment has thrown light on the intensifying pressure faced by law enforcement agencies around the country, which are grappling with budget cuts and rising crime rates. The Inspectorate called for immediate action to address the issue, suggesting that workforce planning and recruitment efforts are not keeping pace with the departure or retirement of experienced staff. HMIC emphasized that higher quality leadership and management, coupled with the implementation of a more strategic workforce plan, can help to stave off the staffing crisis. Public safety is potentially at risk if these concerns are not addressed promptly. The HMIC's findings serve as an urgent call to action for the police forces to bolster their ranks and ensure the public's trust in their ability to maintain law and order.
Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim.

The visit emphasized their commitment to supporting both the natural and cultural treasures of the regions they visit, showcasing the important balance between conservation and cultural heritage.
The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the government, indicating a stark educational inequality between the two regions. The research revealed that economically disadvantaged students in the capital are more than twice as likely to achieve good GCSE results compared to their counterparts in northern England. It emerges as a sign of the notable success of the London Challenge Program, initiated in the early 2000s, aimed at improving school performance in the city. However, this only accentuates the widening educational gap within the country. The IPPR suggested that the government should consider implementing similar initiatives in the north, to improve the quality of education and opportunities for children living in deprived circumstances. The report also sparked urgent calls for a "Northern Powerhouse" strategy for education, to address the alarming regional disparities and ensure that every child, irrespective of their socio-economic background, has an equal shot at success.
North, 24, landed on his head after a high tackle from Adam Thompstone in his side's 19-11 defeat against Leicester Tigers on Saturday. The incident sparked major concern for the player's health as North remained motionless on the pitch for several minutes before being stretchered off. Medical staff were quick to tend to the rugby star, with early reports suggesting that he may have suffered a concussion. The incident has reignited debates about player safety in rugby, with some calling for stricter enforcement of high-tackle rules. The Rugby Football Union, the sport's governing body, has announced that it will conduct an immediate review into the incident.  North's team, Northampton Saints, issued a statement expressing their concern for the player's well-being and promising to support him throughout his recovery. North has a history of concussions, which adds to the collective worry surrounding his recent injury. This incident underscores the inherent risks of contact sports and calls for a renewed focus on player safety.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread "misinformation", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies. According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients. The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS. This dispute underscores a broader tension within the healthcare sector, as professionals and policymakers grapple with how to best manage and deliver care in an increasingly complex and challenging environment.

The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker. As the South Korean company planned to disclose its revolutionary device, unforeseen setbacks have overshadowed its moment of glory. The tech giant has been grappling with mounting consumer complaints regarding the model's functionality and practicality. The South Korean titan had envisaged its latest creation as an embodiment of cutting-edge technology, aiming to set a new benchmark in the highly competitive smartphone market.

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would amount to approximately $2 million annually, a considerable injection into the city's economy. The municipality's plan is to recycle these engines and parts for other uses, aiming to promote a more sustainable city model. This decision follows the city's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote an eco-friendly transportation system. The fleet's reduction has raised concerns among certain groups, which argue that it could lead to delays in public services. Despite this, the city council insists it's an essential move towards sustainability and efficient resource management. The savings will be redirected to enhance public transportation services and infrastructure, which is expected to benefit around 700,000 daily commuters. The city council believes this plan will not only benefit the environment but also promote a healthier lifestyle among residents. The removal is set to commence next month.

Perth Sheriff Court was told there that McCormack, 45, was unaware of the incident due to the size of his vehicle. The incident occurred near the town of Pitlochry in the Scottish Highlands, causing serious damage to the impacted car but leaving its driver uninjured. The court heard that McCormack only became aware of the accident hours later when he stopped at a service station and noticed the damage to his lorry. McCormack, of Inverness, pleaded guilty to failing to stop and report an accident. Defence solicitor, Mr. David Sinclair argued that McCormack genuinely had no idea that he had hit another car.

Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, akin to Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices using voice commands, delivering a hands-free, convenient experience. However, in a bid to make this feature more accessible, Google announced recently that it will be expanding the availability of Google Assistant to a wider range of smartphones. This strategic move aims to compete directly with Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, offering users of other Android devices the same high-quality, intelligent voice-controlled virtual assistant. This expansion will enable more users to enjoy the benefits of Google Assistant, such as setting reminders, sending texts, or asking for directions, all by just using their voice.  This initiative places Google at the forefront of the drive to make technology more intuitive and user-friendly. By democratizing this cutting-edge technology, Google is not only reinforcing its commitment to innovation but also to inclusivity, ensuring all Android users can enjoy the benefits of a virtual assistant.

However, the UN emphasized the need for authorities to thoroughly investigate reported cases of electoral misconduct and to ensure that those responsible are held accountable. It also urged all parties to exercise patience as the Inec continues to tally the results, and to maintain the peace that has so far characterized the election process.
Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Scottish highlands yesterday. Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the treacherous terrain of the Highlands, sparking a large-scale search and rescue operation. The trio, all experienced hikers, were last seen embarking on a walking trail near Ben Nevis, Britain’s highest peak, early Tuesday morning. Alarm bells rang after they failed to return to their lodging by late evening, which was unusual given their hiking routine. Mountain rescue teams from Fort William, Lochaber, and Skye, as well as a coastguard helicopter, were deployed for the search operation. Despite challenging weather conditions, including heavy rain, strong winds, and low visibility, the search teams have remained optimistic. Relatives of Stewart, a retired professor, described him as 'extremely fit and experienced,' expressing hope for his safe return.

Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 4.9%, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This static rate reflects the stability in the UK job market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties.  The numbers signify that the UK economy continues to display resilience, maintaining a relatively low level of unemployment. Economists have noted the robustness of the job market, attributing it to a combination of flexible working arrangements and sustained consumer spending.  However, experts have also pointed out that while the overall unemployment figures are positive, they do not explicitly reflect the quality of work available. Underemployment and the prevalence of zero-hour contracts are ongoing issues, which the headline figures fail to address.  These statistics underpin the complex reality of the job market, which, while demonstrating overall strength and stability, also reveals areas that require significant improvement. Further investigation into improving employment quality, not just quantity, is needed to assure a truly healthy economy.

"When he explained who he was, it was like meeting a legend in person," said young fan, Tinashe Moyo, who had never had the chance to see the wicketkeeper-batsman play in his prime.  In his ten-year career, Taibu was renowned for his technical proficiency, agility behind the stumps, and captaincy. His retirement shocked many, as he was still at the peak of his prowess, but he cited personal and family reasons for his decision. Since hanging up his cricket pads, Taibu has devoted his time to promoting and developing the sport at grassroots level in African communities. Many young athletes have benefited from his mentorship and training, and his dedication to giving back to the sport has been lauded by sporting and community figures alike. Taibu's career might have ended on the pitch, but his

This social media trend saw internet users recasting famous movie scenes in the context of the country's fuel shortage, blending humor and frustration. The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm sparked hundreds of thousands of tweets, reflecting the French public's concern and exasperation over the energy crisis. Twitter users cleverly inserted the issue into famous scenes from films like Mad Max, Titanic, and Back to the Future. One humorous tweet suggested a reimagined Pulp Fiction where John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters argue over who must push their out-of-gas car. While the hashtag speaks to the French's knack for humor in crises, it underscores a pressing issue. France has been grappling with fuel shortages due to strikes at oil refineries and blockades protesting against government policies. This virtual outcry reflects the public's call for effective solutions to the country's escalating fuel crisis.
Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there were increasing concerns about the number of Australian teenagers being radicalized and trying to join extremist groups overseas. The 17-year-old, whose identity has been withheld due to privacy laws, was stopped under Operation Rampart, a joint initiative by the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, aimed at identifying and deterring individuals from travelling overseas to participate in hostile activities.  Mr. Dutton warned that extremist groups were actively targeting vulnerable young Australians online, leveraging their sense of isolation or grievances to push radical ideologies. The incident underscores the ongoing threat of homegrown extremism, in a country that has largely been insulated from the global scourge of terrorism. The Minister urged parents and guardians to keep a vigilant eye on the online activities of their children, raising awareness of the risks associated with radicalisation. He also assured the public that the Government is committed to doing everything in its power to protect Australians from such threats.
The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night voting session, further polarizing the already divided nation.  Opponents of the initiative argue that it is a thinly veiled attempt by the government to whitewash the crimes of exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, allowing him to return without facing corruption charges. Proponents, however, claim the legislation is a crucial step towards healing the deep wounds of the political crisis that has gripped the country for over a decade. The bill has sparked mass protests in the capital, Bangkok, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition. It is a move that is likely to exacerbate the political instability that has plagued Thailand since the 2006 military coup.  As the bill moves to the Senate for further consideration, the nation waits with bated breath, its future hanging in the balance. The coming weeks will no doubt be
Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to restore and revitalize the native woodland environment.  The initiative, supported by the Scottish Natural Heritage, aims to combat the continuous deforestation that has plagued the country and foster a more sustainable ecology. Rehabilitation of the woodland through planting acorns will bring back the natural biodiversity that once thrived in these areas. Not only will the project aid in environmental recuperation, but it will also provide a habitat for local wildlife, particularly endangered species who rely on the forest ecosystem for survival. It is expected that the reforestation will attract a range of fauna, from birds to mammals, contributing to a more balanced ecosystem. Furthermore, the initiative will provide an educational opportunity for the local community, allowing them to engage with nature in a meaningful and hands-on way. By participating in the planting, locals can contribute to the preservation of their natural heritage, while learning about

The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be provided after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote should be held before such a move could be made. The seeming inconsistency has sparked a fierce debate among political parties and citizens alike, questioning the party's commitment to financial transparency and accountability. Critics suggest that the move is a strategic ploy for the party to gain a political advantage, while supporters argue that it is a necessary step toward ensuring the smooth allocation of resources. The decision has also raised questions about the party's adherence to the St David's Day Agreement, which many view as a cornerstone of political practice and a pillar of democratic engagement.  The party, in response to the concerns raised, maintains its stance that this move is in line with its commitment to strengthen democracy and promote fairer distribution of resources. Despite the controversy, the party stands firm on its decision, stating that the referendum is not an obstacle, but a necessary democratic process.
Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden, in what has proven to be a disappointing week for British football clubs in the continental leagues. The colossal defeat faced by Hibs, despite their spirited performance, illuminated the glaring gap between British clubs and their European counterparts. Bayern Munich, the German titans, demonstrated their ruthlessness and superior gameplay, leaving the Scottish team in turmoil.  City, on the other hand, succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Eskilstuna United. The loss was a bitter pill to swallow for City fans, as hopes were high following their robust performances in domestic leagues. The Swedish team capitalized on City's defensive errors, adding more woes to British football in Europe.  These two games have led to intensified calls for a restructuring of British football, focusing more on developing home-grown talent capable of competing on the international stage. The teams will now have to reg
It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future with Uber announcing its expansion into the e-bike rental industry. The ride-hailing giant has acquired Jump, a startup that provides dockless electric bikes allowing users to pick up and drop off bikes anywhere in the city. This move is a strategic pivot for Uber, a company traditionally associated with private car services, showcasing their willingness to adapt to the changing landscape of urban transportation. As we move towards a more sustainable and interconnected world, shared modes of transport, including bike sharing systems like Jump, are increasingly viewed as a viable alternative to private vehicle ownership. While there are still kinks to iron out, such as regulation and infrastructure, this acquisition indicates we're one step closer to a future where personal vehicle ownership may not be the norm.

The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone "flash past" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No immediate damage was reported, but air traffic controllers were alerted about the potential hazard. The drone, estimated to be about a meter across, was flying well above the legal altitude limit for unmanned aircraft, at an estimated height of 4,000 feet.

A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care. The survey, which involved over 1,000 participants across various job sectors, reflected a persistent stigma associated with paternity leave. Many new fathers reported feeling pressured to return to work due to concerns about job security, income stability, and perceptions of traditional gender roles.

As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast during the upcoming annual 12th July demonstrations. This ruling, confirmed by the Parades Commission, follows an unsuccessful appeal by the Carrick Hill Residents Association, who had requested that no loyalist marches be allowed past the Catholic church.  The decision is seen as a way to avoid clashes and maintain social harmony, following a history of sectarian unrest associated with the parade, which commemorates the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. As part of the ruling, only a single drumbeat will be played by the bands while passing the contentious area.  Furthermore, the Commission has stipulated that no supporters will be allowed to accompany the march past the church. Both the Orangemen and the residents have been encouraged to continue dialogue to ensure the peaceful passing of the parade.

Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but recent developments have urged a reconsideration of the case. The Mcleod family has long suspected foul play, alleging a cover-up by the local police force. The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) has now decided to reopen the case, following numerous appeals by the family and the emergence of new evidence.

Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and her ten-year-old daughter, Lauren Thornton. The pair were found dead on a boat owned by Eteson, moored on Lake Windermere in April 2013. It's alleged that their untimely deaths were the result of carbon monoxide poisoning, resulting from a faulty generator Eteson had reportedly installed on the boat. The prosecution states that Eteson, a gas fitter by trade, had a duty of care towards his partner and her daughter and failed to meet it. They argue that it was his negligence in failing to ensure that the generator was safe that led directly to the tragic deaths.  Eteson denies the charges, his defense team plans to argue that the deaths were a tragic accident. The trial is expected to last for several weeks, with the outcome having potential legal implications for boat owners nationwide.
NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has stated that blood group O negative is crucial, as it can be used for patients with other blood types, making it especially valuable in emergency situations.

The process is quick, easy, and can potentially save lives. Every donation can help or save up to three lives,
The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a "disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum." This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities. Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses. The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector. Whether the change will bring the desired effect in broadening the curriculum remains to be seen.

S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has endorsed this initiative, suggesting the review will ensure a more transparent and accountable broadcasting service.  The BBC currently operates under a Royal Charter, which is up for renewal every 10 years. This review will assess its public purposes, funding, and governance structure. Critics have raised concerns about the potential for political interference, however, Davies argued that the review will only enhance the BBC’s ability to deliver high-quality content to its viewers. S4C, the Welsh-language public-service television channel, will also be impacted by this review. It heavily relies on the licence fee, receiving around 90% of its income from this source. The review will scrutinise the efficiency and effectiveness of this funding model, potentially impacting S4C's future operation. The results of the review will be awaited with interest by both viewers and broadcasters.
The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest rate since December 2018, providing positive signals about the Scottish job market.  The report indicates an accelerated increase in permanent staff appointments, and recruiters signaled a strong upturn in short-term roles. This surge is particularly notable after the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. The demand for workers is increasing in various sectors, with IT & Computing leading the way in permanent staff demand, whereas Nursing/Medical/Care topped the demand for temporary staff. Moreover, the availability of candidates for permanent roles deteriorated at a steep and accelerated rate, leading to a surge in starting salaries. Meanwhile, temp wages also grew at a faster pace.  This data suggests that Scotland's job market is bouncing back robustly, with increasing demand for both permanent and temporary staff and growing wages, bringing a much-needed boost to the Scottish economy.
Envoy Sigrid Kaag was speaking as Syria appeared to miss a Sunday deadline to remove its arsenal from the country. All Syria's chemical weapons were supposed to have been shipped out by February 5th, but a failure to meet this deadline has led to growing international concern. Envoy Sigrid Kaag, who heads the joint mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations, voiced her concerns about the delay. She reiterated that the international community is closely watching the situation. "This is not a deadline to be missed lightly," Kaag said.

As the deadline passed, only around 11% of Syria's chemical arsenal had been removed, according to the OPCW. The international community is calling on Syria to accelerate the process. The delay not only puts the disarmament process at risk but also underscores the complexity and challenges of eliminating Syria's sizable chemical weapons program amidst an ongoing civil war.

The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000, leaving local farmers and suppliers in a precarious situation. The firm's sudden closure sent shockwaves through the local economy as it was one of the major employers in the area.

Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of a sophisticated benefit fraud scheme, resulting in the embezzlement of over £450,000 of taxpayer’s money. Investigations revealed that the group had submitted fraudulent applications for tax credits and other benefits over a span of five years. The Stoke Crown Court heard that Akhtar was the mastermind behind the operation that involved his family members and several close friends.

The prosecution said that the money stolen funded a lifestyle far beyond their legitimate means. Despite the severity of the crime, the defendants maintained their innocence throughout the trial. The judge, in his statement, said that their actions were a "deeply regrettable betrayal of trust" and sentenced the group to a combined total of 20 years of imprisonment.

However, this lightly taken comment has sparked a pivotal discussion across the nation about the dangerous influence of misinformation on public discourse and democratic processes.

That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economic and Peace (IEP) stated. The report, unveiling the staggering cost of violence globally, stated that the economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2022 was $14.96 trillion. This figure does not merely represent the direct costs of violence, but also incorporates the additional economic activity that would have transpired if these resources had been directed towards more beneficial ends. The IEP explained that the cost of violence equates to 11.6% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), or $1,998 for every person. The highest economic impact was observed in Syria, where the cost of violence is estimated at 60% of its GDP. These figures underline the urgent need for peace and stability to enable sustainable economic development. The report concluded that fostering peace not only saves lives but is economically prudent. Precious resources can be diverted away from conflict and violence towards positive growth. It is a wake-up call for policymakers to invest in peace building and conflict-resolution
Falcon and Pointer was fined £175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined £50,000 for nuisance calls. This comes as part of a continuing clamping down by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on companies breaching privacy laws. Falcon and Pointer were accused of making over 2.5 million automated calls about PPI claims, causing significant distress and annoyance to the recipients. In fact, the ICO received 5,535 complaints about the company's practices.  Similarly, Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was hit with a hefty fine following 168 complaints about unsolicited marketing calls made to people who had specifically opted out of receiving such communications. The ICO is showing its commitment to protect the privacy and rights of individuals from companies that disregard the law. These fines should serve as a stark warning to other companies engaging in similar practices - they could be next in the ICO's line of fire. The public is advised to report any nuisance calls to the ICO.
The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked from City Hospital last week, triggering a wave of outrage among their colleagues. The nurses' union argues that the two were merely defending themselves against an aggressive patient, who is known to have a history of violent behavior and mental health issues. They claim that the hospital's management has failed to provide adequate security or safeguards for its staff against such incidents. This dismissal, they contend, sets a dangerous precedent and underscores a lack of support for the staff's safety. The walkout has significantly impacted the hospital operations with many non-emergency procedures being delayed. The management is currently in talks with the nurses' union, hoping to resolve the situation quickly. However, the protesting nurses are firm on their stand and demand a full investigation into the incident before they return to work. They insist that their dismissal was unjust and the administration should address their concerns over workplace safety.

The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that the new approach will provide a more efficient and effective means for patients seeking treatment for minor ailments, potentially cutting down waiting times and easing the pressure on general practices. The service is a strategic step in implementing the overarching goal of NHS England to manage antibiotic resistance, a growing health concern worldwide. Overuse of antibiotics has been linked to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, posing a significant global health risk. The walk-in service will be based in pharmacies across England, with trained practitioners providing on-the-spot advice and treatment without the requirement of an appointment. The list of ailments to be covered under the service includes sore throats, colds, and minor infections. NHS England believes that this initiative will not only reduce the strain on GP surgeries and hospitals but also help in educating the public about the perils of overusing antibiotics. By integrating pharmacies more deeply into the healthcare
The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a "growing threat", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, one of the country's most active, has seen a significant upsurge in activity in recent months, raising concerns among scientists about a potential major eruption.

In particular, the alarming rate of ground swelling around the volcano indicates a significant increase in magma supply.  While the local authorities are taking necessary precautions, the situation serves as a reminder of the unpredictable and devastating power of nature. The current escalation at Sakurajima underscores the urgent

The arrests have sparked considerable outrage within the community and beyond, highlighting the broader issue of how law enforcement deals with individuals suffering from mental health disorders. Critics argue that police should be better trained to handle such situations, ensuring that individuals with conditions like Smith-Magenis Syndrome are treated fairly and with compassion.  This case serves as a stark reminder of the dire need for reform within law enforcement, and for a more empathetic approach to policing

The Port Talbot-based Specific Innovation Centre is working on the revolutionary concept of "buildings as power stations". An ambitious project, it is a collaborative effort involving Tata Steel, Swansea University and AkzoNobel, aiming to create a sustainable future for the construction industry. At its core, the project aims to develop buildings that can generate, store, and release their own solar energy. This innovative approach to energy production and consumption could transform the way we perceive and use buildings. Tata Steel provides the building materials, Swansea University brings its expertise in solar energy research, while AkzoNobel, a global paint and coatings company, ensures the buildings are not only energy efficient but aesthetically pleasing as well. The Specific innovation Centre's project offers a glimpse into a sustainable future where buildings contribute to energy production rather than being solely consumers of it. It marks a significant step towards a greener and more sustainable construction sector, providing a model that could be replicated worldwide
Erika Murray, 31, was arrested on Thursday night after a neighbour alerted police over the safety of other children living at the house. Detectives swiftly responded to the call, arriving at the residence to initiate investigation.  Upon arriving, officers found conditions to be severely neglectful and hazardous. The children present, all under the age of 10, were immediately taken into protective custody due to the apparent immediate threats to their wellbeing.  While details surrounding the case remain to be fully disclosed, preliminary reports indicate that the children lived amidst squalor, with insufficient food and sanitation. Authorities express their deep concern over the long-term physical and psychological health of the affected children.  Charged with multiple counts of child endangerment, Murray is set to face a judge early next week. As the investigation continues, authorities are working diligently to ensure the safety and welfare of the children involved. More updates will be provided as this heartbreaking story unfolds.
The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded the Cure the NHS group after the death of her mother at the hospital in 2007, said that the levels of neglect were horrifying. She related stories of starving patients forced to eat from bins, and of those left in agony as overworked nurses failed to administer medication. Perhaps most concerning was the revelation that unqualified receptionists were often left to evaluate patients in emergency cases. A report into the scandal, published in 2013, found that between 400 and 1,200 patients may have died unnecessarily due to subpar care. The damning evidence has led to a national conversation about healthcare standards in the UK, and about the systemic failings that can lead to such a disaster. Bailey continues to fight for justice and reform, insisting that nothing short of a complete overhaul of the system will prevent the same issues from recurring in the future.

Root's vice-captain will be Ben Stokes.
Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin ships, leaving cargo stranded and causing chaos in global trade.  Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports worldwide, from Shanghai to New York, have refused to accept Hanjin's cargo ships due to uncertainty over who would pay docking fees, container storage, and unloading bills. This has led to an unprecedented logjam in the global supply chain. Hundreds of thousands of containers carrying more than $14 billion worth of goods are stranded at sea, affecting retailers and manufacturers worldwide. The impact is especially severe as preparations for the holiday season are underway, causing considerable disruption and potential losses.  The collapse of Hanjin, the world's seventh-largest container shipper, has sent shockwaves through the global shipping industry, which is already grappling with low freight rates due to an excess of ships and slowing global trade. The South Korean government's decision not to rescue Hanjin has raised questions about the future of other struggling shippers, potentially triggering

In light of this situation, the palace has not announced any changes to the Queen's schedule for the upcoming week. People across the nation are sending their best wishes to the Queen
The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year. A probation report three months earlier had identified Jetha as a potential risk to minors but lamentably, authorities failed to act.  The attack, which occurred in Leicester, sparked public outrage and demands for a review of the probation system. It was revealed that Jetha, a 35-year-old man with a history of violent behavior, was not properly monitored after the damning report. Prosecutors say the victim was subjected to a terrifying ordeal that has left her traumatized. The attack became a watershed moment, prompting serious questions about the effectiveness of the probation service in predicting and preventing such horrifying incidents.  Jetha has since been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Meanwhile, the victim's family, with the support of their local community, is calling for a complete overhaul of the probation system to ensure no other child falls through the cracks.
They began their trip by travelling to the Seamus Heaney Homeplace Centre in Bellaghy, where they met members of the poet's family and local enthusiasts of his work.

The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be a significant step forward in elevating the quality of international education in the UK. The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. This move comes in response to concerns that some international students lack sufficient English proficiency to fully engage in their chosen academic courses. Scott stated, "Higher English proficiency standards can ensure students not only succeed acadically but also integrate better into the local community and culture." Critics argue that the move could deter potential students from applying to UK universities. However, Scott countered that it will attract students genuinely interested in improving their language skills and learning. The proposal forms part of a wider government initiative to uphold the integrity and quality of UK higher education amidst increasing global competition. It's hoped that these changes might also encourage UK students to consider studying foreign languages, fostering a more global outlook in the nation's youth. The proposal is yet to receive final approval and is currently under review.
The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be wary and take necessary precautions to safeguard their financial interests. This follows from a recent study on the business practices of card providers, which revealed that their intervention in the financial decisions of profitable customers is minimal, often leading to unchecked spending.  The FCA urged consumers to be more pro-active about their financial decisions, and not to rely solely on card companies for advice or intervention. It also recommended that customers regularly review their credit card usage and take advantage of financial tools and resources to manage their spending effectively.  The FCA's statement highlights the need for consumer vigilance in a financial landscape that is often stacked in favor of card providers. The call for consumers to take charge of their financial decisions underscores the importance of financial literacy in today's society.
Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his controversial bid for a third term. This sparked a series of protests and a failed coup attempt, leading to the death of over 400 people and displacing more than 240,000. These arrests mark a deepening crisis for freedom of press in Burundi, a nation already beleaguered with political and societal unrest. The journalists, whose identities have not yet been released, were reportedly taken into custody while on assignment, capturing the turbulent situation in the capital, Bujumbura. International press groups and human rights organizations have protested against the arrests, calling for the immediate release of the journalists and urging the Burundian government to respect press freedom and human rights. The arrest of journalists not only undermines the principles of free press, but also obstructs the world's understanding of the crises that Burundi
Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote in his report that Mr Butler found it "difficult to control his anger", which was alarmingly indicative of his pattern of violent behavior. This observation has now resurfaced after Butler was convicted of further violent crimes, highlighting a disappointing failure of the legal and therapeutic systems in managing and averting such cases. Butler's psychological assessment, made public after recent legal proceedings, underscored the warning signs that were seemingly overlooked. His inability to manage his angry reactions, which led to acts of violence, was not adequately addressed nor were preventive measures put in place. The case of Ben Butler exposes a larger problem in the system where insufficient attention is given to repeated offenders exhibiting signs of systemic violence. It challenges the efficacy of our rehabilitative measures and prompts a call for more proactive action in managing violent individuals. The system's ability to protect citizens from repeat offenders remains under scrutiny.

Historically revered as the Holy Grail, this artifact has been shrouded in mystery and intrigue for centuries. The fragile piece of wood is all that remains of the Nanteos Cup, a wooden chalice named after the mansion in Aberystwyth, Wales, where it was preserved. The cup, believed to have been made in the 14th century, has been at the center of many a legend, with some even claiming it to be the Holy Grail itself, the cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper. In recent years, the Nanteos Cup has suffered extensive damage, reducing it to a small fragment.

These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania, by a group of wildlife photographers who couldn't believe their eyes.  The lioness, dubbed 'Mother Theresa of the Animal Kingdom,' was seen suckling a leopard cub estimated to be just three weeks old. Experts claim it is rare for a lioness to nurse another's offspring, let alone from another species. This rare interspecies interaction has captured the hearts of wildlife enthusiasts across the globe. Scientists from the WildCRU at Oxford University have suggested that the unusual relationship could be the result of the lioness’ strong maternal instincts. The leopard cub, possibly orphaned or abandoned, has found an unlikely savior.  As wild predators continue to be threatened by human encroachment, poaching, and climate change, this heartwarming story serves as a poignant reminder of the beauty and

The focus now shifts to the County Championship, where they hope to maintain their newly gained top-tier status. This setback in the tournament, they believe, could be the catalyst
The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been slashed by a significant percentage as part of a series of measures to boost a slowing economy. Economists predict this bold move may trigger a slew of similar cuts across the globe, potentially heralding a new era of competitive interest rate reductions. The decision, announced by the Central Bank on Friday, is widely seen as a response to persistent low inflation and weaker-than-expected growth figures. The Bank said the move aims to "ensure the stability of the financial system and foster sustainable economic growth." Market watchers believe the surprise rate cut could serve as a strong stimulus for the struggling economy, providing much-needed liquidity and encouraging borrowing. The move is expected to boost business confidence and spur investment, which could in turn lead to job creation and increased consumer spending, further stimulating economic growth. However, some analysts caution that the decision could also lead to increased financial risk
The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called "bearer bonds". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy owners to potentially evade tax obligations.  The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called "bearer bonds". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to potentially dodge tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly leading the probe, which could hold significant implications for global finance.  Bearer bonds, which were outlawed in the US in 1982 due to their use in money laundering and tax evasion, are still legal in other countries, including Switzerland. Critics argue that these unregistered securities are a loophole in tax law that primarily benefits the ultra-wealthy.  The investigation comes amid increased efforts by US authorities to crack down on offshore tax evasion. The Swiss bank, which has not been named, could face severe penalties if found guilty of facilitating tax evasion through the sale of bearer bonds. The bank has not offered any comment on the investigation as of yet.

It must navigate through this period with transparency and accountability to demonstrate its commitment to ethical conduct. The outcome of this saga could have far-reaching implications, not just for the company, but for the broader business environment as well.
The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase without needing to visit a separate website. The company's chief business officer, Omid Kordestani, confirmed the upcoming roll-out of the "Buy Now" button during a conference. This move is seen as a direct response to combat the increasing dominance of Amazon in the online shopping industry. The "Buy Now" button will aim to streamline the shopping experience for Google users by allowing purchases to be made directly from the search results page. This presents a major shift in Google's strategy, as it transitions from being solely a search engine to a more integrated service provider.  Google's decision comes after research indicated that many users start their shopping searches on Amazon rather than Google. By implementing this new feature, the tech giant hopes to reclaim some of this lost market share, enhancing customer convenience and boosting its advertising revenues in the process. While the exact roll-out date remains undisclosed, Google users worldwide anticipate a streamlined and more efficient online shopping experience. With the competition heating up, this could be a game-changer in the e-commerce sphere.

An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid rent for the last three years. The Vale of Glamorgan-based maintenance and repair firm, co-owned by Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson, faces financial difficulties since 2019, leading to delayed rent payments. The official disclosed that the outstanding rent totals an estimated £500,000. The revelation has sparked a significant concern among the assembly members over the administration's measures to ensure the collection of due payments. The company's failure to pay rent has put additional financial pressure on St Athan, already struggling due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Assembly members are now urging the administration to take immediate action to recoup the lost funds. Cardiff Aviation is yet to comment on the matter. This situation has highlighted the need for stricter enforcement of lease agreements to protect public finances.
The number given for the current account customers hit by the fraud is fewer than half of the 20,000 initially reported to have been affected. Personal information and account numbers were exposed in a sophisticated scam, causing widespread panic among account holders.  The breach, orchestrated by a group of cybercriminals, initially appeared to have impacted one in every hundred customers of the major bank. However, following rigorous investigations by the cybercrime department, the actual figure was revised down to less than 10,000.  The bank assured that they have taken immediate action to safeguard those affected, including resetting passwords and monitoring accounts for suspicious activity. They also urged customers to remain vigilant, stressing the importance of not sharing sensitive information via email or over the phone. In a statement, the bank said, "We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this incident may have caused. We are committed to protecting our customers' data and have taken steps to prevent such incidents in the future."
The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The case has recently resurfaced, prompting questions about the efficiency of law enforcement in such matters. Despite the woman's numerous reports to the police regarding Hutsby's conduct, it appears that the accused was not appropriately dealt with at the time, which led to an escalation of the situation. Hutsby was initially placed on bail for minor charges, but his subsequent threatening behaviour towards the woman showed a blatant disregard for the conditions of his release. Victims of such incidents are now demanding a review of how law enforcement agencies handle cases of this nature, calling for more effective and timely responses. This case exposes the gaps in our current system, highlighting the importance of immediate and decisive action in instances of reported threats and breaches of bail conditions. In the face of mounting public pressure, authorities are expected to take significant steps to remedy the situation, reaffirm

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a minimum dress code, and proof of right to work in the UK, from taxi drivers in an effort to improve services and enhance safety for passengers. This comes as an initiative to address a number of issues that have been raised by passengers and the taxi industry. The proposed tests would be an addition to the already rigorous requirements set by the TfL for taxi drivers, including a topographical test and a medical check. The English language test is aimed to ensure that drivers can effectively communicate with passengers, while the map-reading assessment is designed to improve navigational skills. The introduction of a minimum dress code is to maintain a professional image, whereas the proof of right to work in the UK is a measure to comply with immigration laws. These changes are expected to raise the standard of service provided by taxi drivers in London and enhance passengers' overall experience. The consultation is due to commence in the coming weeks and will last for three months.
The Saddlers looked more likely to take the lead in the first half, with Albion goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin keeping out Paul Downing and Romaine Sawyers' attempts at the goal. However, despite the initial strong performance from the Saddlers, the game remained goalless at the half-time whistle. The audience witnessed an intense tussle between the two teams, with the Saddlers maintaining a steady control over the game. Their attacking prowess was clearly seen as they dominated the field, forcing McLaughlin to make several vital saves.

Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been identified in a recent research study conducted by the College of Policing. The findings suggest that officers were primarily focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other significant risk factors. This bias towards violent offences may be compromising the efficacy of policing in these areas, potentially leaving citizens vulnerable to other types of crime. The research highlighted the need for deeper insights and broader scopes in threat assessments to ensure comprehensive law enforcement. The three unnamed police forces have reportedly taken the findings on board and are now reassessing their approaches to address this issue. The findings also urge for improved training and resource allocation, particularly for areas of crime that may not involve violence but are equally detrimental, such as cybercrime, fraud, and drug offenses. The College of Policing hopes that this research can provide an impetus for change, not just within the three forces investigated, but across all forces, improving the overall standard of public safety.
The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, signalling a significant shift from Japan's post-war pacifism and marking a milestone in its military normalization. The bill, if approved by the upper house, would extend Japan's military options by ending a ban on exercising collective self-defense, or aiding an ally under attack. While supporters argue that it is crucial for Japan to strengthen its role in global security amid growing regional threats, the move has triggered widespread protests from citizens and constitutional scholars who contend it violates Japan's constitution and could potentially embroil the country in U.S.-led conflicts around the globe. This legislation is a reflection of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push for Japan to take on a more assertive military posture, a stance that has raised eyebrows within the international community.

The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, drawing inspiration from Steven Spielberg's blockbuster of the same name. The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial, sealed in a New Mexico landfill. The game's lackluster reception and commercial failure famously led Atari to bury unsold and returned copies, marking a notorious chapter in video gaming history. Atari, once a giant in the gaming industry, was forced to bury approximately 700,000 cartridges in the Alamogordo landfill following the video game crash of 1983. The ET game earned a reputation as one of the worst games ever due to its confusing gameplay and poor graphics. Its failure, coupled with a general oversaturation of the market, contributed significantly to Atari's financial downfall. The buried cartridges were unearthed in 2014, confirming rumors that have circulated for years. Now a symbol of the volatile boom and bust cycle in the gaming industry, the ET game serves as a fascinating relic of video gaming's

The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a modern, state-of-the-art retirement complex. The proposal includes 74 apartments and a host of luxurious amenities for residents to enjoy. However, the plan has sparked widespread controversy among local residents and historians, due to the hotel's iconic status and its cultural importance as a former haunt of Stevenson. They argue that the building holds significant historic value and should be preserved rather than demolished. The hotel, which has stood empty since 2014, was reportedly a hub for smugglers in the 18th century, and it is claimed Stevenson, famed for his adventure novels, stayed there while writing 'Treasure Island'. Despite the backlash, PegasusLife maintains that their proposal will bring a much-needed boost to the local economy through job creation and increased tourism. The final decision is awaited from the local council.
